# deploy/console.nomad.hcl — the console: the page and the API.
# A system job: one instance on every server that runs a resource, so that
# any server's :8080 is the console and nothing sits in front of it — no
# load balancer, no ingress; a person types any server's name, or a DNS
# name that resolves to all of them. It is stateless and holds no database:
# every instance reads the same raft and the same heartbeats, /events asks
# every live resource's event index and merges, and a retried POST is answered
# the same by whichever instance gets it because the Idempotency-Key is a
# Variable (vms/idem/*).
# Placed on servers that run a resource so that an operator's marks have a
# bucket to go into; drop the constraint and /marks answers 503 there.
