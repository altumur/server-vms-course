# deploy/resource.nomad.hcl — the resource: a PLATFORM system job, one
# allocation on every server that declares meta.archive, pinned there for
# as long as the server exists. It serves every subsystem's buckets, takes
# mirrors from its peers, retains buckets by each subsystem's own policy,
# runs the passes subsystems register on it (the VMS: manifests, media
# retention), and reads its own tree as the event index — nothing to rebuild,
# a bounded cache of what it read — served as GET /events; the console merges these.
# The same process М10 runs on a box (python3 -m vms resource).
# No controller. Its heartbeat is platform/resources/<server>.
