# The operator's rows and nothing else: a camera's row, the id counter, the
# retention row derived from it, the administrator's policy knob — and the
# same for the recorder it fronts at /rec/… (a recording's row: the Record
# toggle). Not an assignment, not a placement, not a slot — a console that
# could place would be a second controller with a browser in front of it.
# verify-bench.sh proves the "nothing else".
