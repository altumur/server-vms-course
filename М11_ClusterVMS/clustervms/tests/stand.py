"""The module's stand, traced: three servers, the real controller, workers and console, and every call they
make to the cluster's store written down in Nomad's own words (`tests/trace.py`).

Each SCENE is one moment of the module's story, run from nothing, and returns its trace. The lessons quote
these traces; the full ones live in `М11_ClusterVMS/traces/<scene>.txt`, and `test_stand.py` fails the day
the code and a stored trace disagree — so an example in a lesson is a record of a run, never a guess.
