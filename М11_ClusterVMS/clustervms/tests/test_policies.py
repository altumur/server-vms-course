"""The policies and the code say the same thing, and a test says so.

Variables have had an ACL since М10A Lesson 1, and it is derived from the spec:
`acl_controller()`, `acl_console()`, `acl_worker()`. The OBJECT STORE never had
one. On one box that is invisible — `FsObjectStore` has no writer and no prefixes
— and on a cluster the ACL is real, enforced by the scheduler, but written by
hand in `deploy/*-policy.hcl`.

Nothing checked that the hand-written file still matched the code, and inside two
commits it stopped matching three times:

  * the controller's grant named `objects/vms/snapshot` exactly, and the snapshot
    became one object per worker — every shard a 403, every five seconds, logged
    as "placement pass failed";
  * the console got a `blob` route and no grant to write `objects/vms/blobs/*`,
    so the route could not work on a cluster at all;
  * the rec controller never had a grant for its own snapshot, from the day it
    was written.

None of the three is subtle. All three were invisible because the suite runs
against a store with no ACL, and the file with the ACL is not code.

So: the grants are derived from the spec (`acl_objects_*`), and this checks each
policy against them in BOTH directions — everything the code writes is allowed,
and nothing else is.
