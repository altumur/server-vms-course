"""Where is camera 7 — answered from the cluster in one scan.

`vms/workers/*` is the assignment, written by the controller into one raft
and read by every worker from the same raft; scanning it is the cluster
directory, and it is *consistent* because it is one store. М12 aggregates
several of these and cannot be — which is why the question is answered here.
