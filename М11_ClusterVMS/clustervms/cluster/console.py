"""The cluster console, standard library — its own job (`system`: one on every server, nothing in front),
its own token (the operator's rows, never placement). The platform's
SpecConsole run from the VMS spec, exactly as М10 runs it; what a CLUSTER
adds is where the bytes and the events are — merged, not held:

    GET /timeline/<id>               merged across the resources that hold the camera's RECORDING (rec/<cam>); unreachable ones named
    GET /segment/<path>?server=<s>   the bytes of one segment, fetched from THAT server's resource job (Range passed through)
    GET /events?from&to&cam&…        merged across the live resources' event indexes (the platform's `MergedIndex`); none here
    /rec/spec, /rec/recordings, …    the recorder mounted under its name (`Mount`): the page's Record toggle POSTs here

The rest — the page, /spec, /cameras, /where (one scan of the assignments),
/resources, /servers, /policy, /unplaceable, /metrics, /marks, POST/PUT/DELETE — is
`w2cplatform.console.SpecConsole` reading `vms.subsystem.yaml`. The recorder's
console at `/rec/…` is the same class over `rec.subsystem.yaml` and no extra.

The console holds no event index. Each resource job keeps one over its
own tree (its buckets and the copies it holds of its peers') and answers
`GET /events` from it; the console asks every live resource and merges by
time — the way `/timeline` merges manifests — naming the ones that did not
answer, dropping a peer's copy when the owner itself answered, and fencing
each event by its unit's current epoch, which only the cluster's rows know.
Exactly what М10's console does with its one resource process: one class.
