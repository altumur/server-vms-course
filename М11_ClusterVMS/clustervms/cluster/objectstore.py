"""The cluster's object store — М10's `w2cplatform.objects.ObjectStore`
contract, which holds three small things: worker heartbeats, resource
heartbeats, and the snapshot the domain's read model is built from.

On a cluster of this size the implementation is `VariablesObjectStore`:
objects as Nomad Variables under `objects/…`. A heartbeat is ~10 KB every
ten seconds from a dozen workers and three resources — a couple of raft
writes a second — which is not the volume the "keep raft small" rule was
about, and it removes a whole store (MinIO, its quorum, its credentials)
from the cluster. The contract is the point: `vms/` and `w2cplatform/` do
not know which one they are talking to. When a cluster grows to where its
heartbeats are a raft load, `open_store("s3+http://…")` is the same three
calls against MinIO or S3 (`s3.py`), and that is also the adapter a rented
cluster uses (М12 Lesson 8). Footage never goes to any of these.

Two adapters with one contract. `HttpObjectStore` PUTs and GETs against any
endpoint that accepts plain HTTP object semantics (MinIO with a bucket
policy, nginx with dav, an S3 presigned pattern behind a proxy).
`FsObjectStore` is a directory — the tests, and a bench with a shared mount.
An S3 adapter with signed requests is a twenty-line boto3 wrapper on the
same two methods; it is not here because the appliance image carries no boto3.
