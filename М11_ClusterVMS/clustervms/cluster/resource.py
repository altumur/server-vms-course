"""The resource job on a cluster is М10's resource process (vms.resource) run as
a `system` job on every server with meta.archive: the platform's Resource with
the VMS registered on it — serving buckets, taking mirrors from its peers,
retaining every subsystem's buckets by that subsystem's policy, and keeping
the event index over its own tree. Nothing here is new; the names say so:
platform/resources/<server>/heartbeat, platform/mirror, job "resource".
