"""Lesson 12 — shared settings without a database.

Some settings belong to the system and not to any one camera: the retention a camera gets when nobody set
one, the folder tree the console offers, the scenarios that tie one camera's event to another's action.
With a server room they live in that cluster's Variables. With cameras as members there is no such place
— every member is its own cluster — and the domain has no database, by decision.

The domain already publishes one thing of this shape: the identity set (Lesson 4), as an object named by a
pointer, object first. Shared settings are the same, with two differences that come from where the copy is
READ — on every member, when the domain may be gone:

    signed          the document carries the signer's signature, by the key set every member already holds.
                    A copy is believed by its signature, not by who handed it over — so any copy is as good
                    as the original, and a member that got it from a stale mirror or a wrong door cannot be
                    fooled by it
    ordered         (term, rev): a member never replaces a newer document with an older one, whatever
                    arrives. The term is Lesson 15's — the domain moved — and it outranks the revision
    kept            each member keeps the last verified document in its own durable store. The domain can be
                    gone for a month; the settings are where they are read
    defaults        a shared setting is a DEFAULT, resolved when it is read. It is never copied into rows:
                    that would make the agent a writer of rows, and a change of default a write to five
                    hundred cameras, each of which might be off

    domain/shared            in the domain holder's Variables: {object, rev, term, sha256} — the pointer, and the CAS
    shared/rev-<n>           in the domain holder's objects: the signed document
    domain/shared            in each member's Variables: the pointer to what it holds, written by its agent
    domain/shared            in each member's durable objects: the document itself
    domain/shared-refused    in each member's Variables: a document it would not take, and why
