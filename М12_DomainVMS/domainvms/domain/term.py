"""Lesson 15 — a domain cluster of one node.

A site of cameras and no server. The domain still has to run somewhere — the signer, the console, the
kept edits, the shared settings — and this module decided long ago where: in ONE designated cluster, with
nothing to fail over to, its key backed up beyond it (Lessons 4 and 7). On a server room that was a drill
done once a year. On a camera it is a Tuesday: cameras are unplugged, their flash wears out, they are
stolen. So re-hosting the domain has to become an ordinary operation, and three things follow.

    a term          the host holds a number, and every re-host takes a larger one. A host that comes back
                    after being replaced sees a larger term on any member and steps down: its writes are
                    refused, and it says to whom they go. The epoch of Lesson 1 of М10A, one level up —
                    and, as there, the loser finds out on its next read, not from a message
    beyond itself   what the domain holds that nobody else does is published to other members, signed, as
                    the shared settings are (Lesson 12). Much of its state already lives on members — each
                    cluster's grants in that cluster — but not all of it: the edit kept for a camera that is
                    OFF (Lesson 9) is, by definition, on no camera that could carry it home. A domain whose
                    host dies takes those with it unless it published them
    stranded        an old host that returns may have made changes after its last backup. They are not
                    silently lost and not silently applied: they are listed, for a person, as "not in term
                    N+1 — apply again?"

    domain/host                 in the host's Variables, and carried to every member: {term, host}, signed
    domain/backup/<member>      in the host's Variables: a pointer, for each member chosen to keep a copy
    backup/rev-<n>              in the host's durable objects: the signed state
    domain/backup               in a chosen member: its agent's copy of the pointer, and of the document

What is NOT in the backup: the signer's key. It is the one thing that must never sit beside the rest, and it
is restored from where Lesson 7 put it — offline, or in the recovery file the installer handed over. Without
it no backup verifies and no member follows the new host, which is the point.
