"""Lesson 3 — the API, and what it refuses.

The domain console's write API is a façade: an edit goes to the directory
("where is camera 7"), then to the OWNING CLUSTER's console — the one in
front of that cluster's controller, the only writer of its vms/* — and that
cluster's grants decide. The domain console owns nothing and never writes
a camera row on its own account; a create goes to the cluster the
placement service chose, and that cluster's controller places it on a
worker (М11 Lesson 10). The domain never names a worker or a server.

    idempotency keys    a retried PUT is the same PUT, not a second edit
    what it refuses     a client may not set placement at either level (cluster, worker, server), nor what
                        a worker observes (phase, observed_revision) or takes (epoch)
    positions/reasons   the read model's `phase` and `position` are passed through untouched
    authentication      Lesson 3 ships it unauthenticated and says so; Lesson 4 adds `verifier`
