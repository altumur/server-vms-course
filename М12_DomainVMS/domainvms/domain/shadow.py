"""Lesson 2 — shadow mode: the domain that writes nothing.

The domain computes what the directory WOULD say, observes what the
clusters' workers report, and emits a divergence report. It changes
nothing. The taxonomy, per CAMERA now that the unit of work is a camera on
a worker rather than a recorder with its own database (М9):

    lagging       a worker has not yet applied a camera's revision, within grace     not a fault
    stalled       behind past grace, no progress                                     the real "it did not take effect"
    orphaned      placed by the domain, and no cluster's snapshot lists it            fault
    unmanaged     a cluster runs a camera the domain never placed                     in shadow mode: a MEASUREMENT
    conflict      two clusters — or two workers — claim one camera                   always a fault — placement or fencing
    stale_epoch   a worker reports a camera under a superseded epoch                  the fence catching a writer that should have stopped

The one number is `unmanaged == 0`: anything running that the model does
not describe is a gap in the model, and driving it to zero IS the design
work. Ordering beats equality: "behind by 4 for 40 minutes" is an incident;
"diverged" is an alert you learn to ignore.
