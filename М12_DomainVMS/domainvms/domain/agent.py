"""The domain agent: one small Nomad job per cluster whose only right is to
write domain/* in that cluster's Variables — the way a worker's only right
is to write its epochs and its slot, and the controller's is vms/*.

It carries the three things a cluster needs from the domain and nothing
else: the signer's public key set, the revocation list, and the grants for
THIS cluster. When the domain is unreachable it stops updating; the
cluster's console and gateway keep verifying with the keys they have,
issued tokens run to expiry, grants run to theirs, nobody new logs in —
the bounded outage the services table promises, with the mechanism named.
Workers are not involved: nothing about a user reaches a worker, ever.
