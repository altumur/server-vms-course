"""Lesson 3 — the camera list, and where the console gets it.

Not a fan-out to N consoles (waits for the slowest, breaks on the first
dead one). Not status in Variables (raft is not for frequent, large data).
The read model reads what each cluster's WORKERS already publish —
`vms/heartbeats/<worker>`, carrying the worker's status per camera, its
server, its epochs — and, for the cameras no worker reports at all, each
cluster's `vms/snapshot/*`. It holds both in memory and serves the list,
search and pagination from there. No call to any worker or controller on
any request. It is a cache that admits to being one: a restart is one pass
over the objects.

The two sources answer different questions and the list keeps them apart.
A heartbeat is an OBSERVATION: this camera is running, at this revision,
on this worker. The snapshot is the CONFIGURATION: this camera is supposed
to exist. A camera that is configured and observed appears once, from the
observation. A camera that is configured and observed by nobody — nothing
placed it, or the worker that holds it has never reported — appears from
the snapshot, marked `configured`, and that is the whole of "set up but
not working" (М10A Lesson 13 shows the same pair inside one cluster, as
`rows` beside `configured`).

Until this was written the list simply did not contain those cameras: an
operator could add one, watch it fail to be placed, and see nothing at all
in the domain — the most confusing shape a fault can take.

Staleness is shown, never hidden: every row carries the age of the
heartbeat it came from; a worker older than `lost_after` is *stale — last
known state*, its cameras still listed. A cluster that did not answer is
reported as such, with its rows from the last successful pass — never as
an empty cluster.

Grouped by failure domain: the heartbeat carries the server the worker runs
on, so when a server dies its workers go silent together and the console
shows ONE cause, not thirty greyed cameras.
