"""Lesson 9 — an edit for a cluster that is off.

Lesson 3 forwarded an edit to the owning cluster and answered 503 when the cluster did not answer. That is
right where a whole cluster is rarely unreachable, and wrong where a cluster is ONE DEVICE — a camera that is
its own cluster, off for its power, its switch, its maintenance, and edited in bulk with forty-nine others.

So the domain keeps the edit, and keeps it the way it keeps everything a cluster needs from it: in the domain
holder's Variables, under `domain/pending/<cluster>`, beside `domain/grants/<cluster>`, carried home by that
cluster's agent when it is back. The cluster's own console applies it. Nothing about ownership moves: the
cluster's console is still the only writer of its rows, and the agent still writes nothing but `domain/*`.

    what is kept     per FIELD, the value the domain last saw (`old`), the value wanted (`new`), and any value
                     it wanted before that may already be on the camera (`via`)
    when it lands    a field that still holds `old` — or a `via` — takes `new`; one that holds `new` is done;
                     one that holds anything else moved underneath the edit — a CONFLICT, shown, not decided
    as whom          the operator who made it, with that operator's grant checked when it is applied
    how it returns   the agent writes the outcome in its own cluster's `domain/outcomes`; the domain reads
                     it the way it reads a snapshot, and clears what landed
