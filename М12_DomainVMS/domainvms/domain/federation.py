"""Lesson 1 — what a cluster cannot know.

A domain is N clusters, each with its own raft (Nomad region), its own
Variables and its own object store. Nothing replicates between them. The
domain's directory is therefore an AGGREGATION over N cluster directories:
partial, stale by a bounded amount, sometimes incomplete — and the honest
response to "where is camera 7" when a cluster is unreachable is "not found
in the clusters I could reach", never a short list rendered as complete.

What a cluster publishes for the domain to read (М11 Lesson 10): one object
PER WORKER under `vms/snapshot/` — the controller's copy of the camera rows
placed on that worker, with the server, carrying a timestamp — plus
`vms/snapshot/unplaced` for the rows nobody holds, and the workers' own
heartbeats. Same shape as the heartbeats, and for the same reason: an object
store has a ceiling, and the one object the snapshot used to be was the only
thing in the platform that grew with the whole cluster. The domain never
reads a cluster's Variables: the rows stay in raft with one writer, and what
leaves is a copy with an age.

`Cluster` is the domain's handle on one region; `Federation` is the list;
`DomainDirectory` merges the snapshots with the incompleteness kept as a
first-class field of every answer.
