"""Lesson 14 — alarms from every member.

The operator of a site of cameras wants ONE list of alarms: the door forced at gate 3, the stream gone at
the loading bay, newest first, whichever camera saw it. Inside a cluster the platform has that list already
— every resource's buckets, merged by `MergedIndex`, with `state` and `truncated` said per source (М10A,
М11). Across members there is no cluster to merge in: each camera's events are on its own card.

So the domain merges, the way the directory merges snapshots — from each member, with what it could not
reach said as part of the answer — and adds the one thing a card does not have: a second copy. A camera
that is off, or whose card has died, is exactly the camera whose last alarms matter most.

    one list        each member's alarms, fetched from its door, merged newest first, each line naming its
                    member. A member asked for at most `per_member` lines, and one that had more says so —
                    a storm on one camera must not push every other camera off the page
    a mirror        a neighbouring member keeps a copy of another's CLOSED alarm buckets. Closed, because a
                    closed bucket never changes: copying it needs no coordination, and a copy is either all
                    there or not there. Alarm lines only: a neighbour's flash is not a second card
    pulled          the copy is made by the one who keeps it, reading the other's door — the platform's rule
                    that the one who lacks takes the initiative. Nothing is written into the source
    chosen          which neighbour keeps whose copy is the domain's decision, by reachability, stored per
                    member and carried by its agent (`domain/mirrors`) — stable, so that one camera added to
                    a site of three hundred moves a handful of copies, not all of them
    honest          a member answered from its mirror says so, and says up to WHEN: the alarms of its open
                    bucket were in no copy, and "none since 14:20" must never read as "none"
