"""Lesson 12 — shared settings without a database.

Defaults, the folder tree, the scenarios between cameras: settings of the system, not of a camera. The
domain publishes them the way it publishes the identity set — one object, named by a pointer, object
first — signed, so that a copy anywhere is as good as the original, and carried by every member's agent
into that member's own durable store, where the member reads them with the domain gone.
