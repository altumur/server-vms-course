"""The controller as a job — and it is М10's, unchanged. What the first
ClusterVMS design added here (label constraints, the server in the reason,
the snapshot for М12, the measured failover) turned out to be the general
behaviour with N = 1: on one box the labels are empty, the server is the
hostname, and the snapshot is what a single-cluster customer's console
reads. So it lives in the platform's SpecController, the VMS's spec names
it, and this module keeps only the name М11's lessons used.

Still no supervisor's client: it never starts a process — it publishes numbers
and offers, and `w2c-spares.sh` on each server starts — and never frees a slot
from a silence alone (`Controller.slot_fate`).
