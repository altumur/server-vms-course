"""Lesson 11 — hundreds of small members, measured.

The module promised a directory and a read view for "low hundreds of clusters' worth". With server rooms
that meant a handful of clusters and hundreds of units; with small boxes as members it means hundreds of
CLUSTERS, each with one unit, and a good share of them off at any moment. The code did not change shape
when the members did. Its cost did, in three places nobody had reason to look at with three clusters:

    per pass        what one pass of the read view asks of every member — counted, not estimated
    per edit        what "where is unit X" costs — the directory scans every member, every call
    per silence     what a member that does not answer costs — on a real link, the whole timeout

`Meter` wraps each member's stores, counts the calls a pass makes, and charges each one what it would cost
on a link: `latency` for an answer, `timeout` for finding out there is none. `pass_time(lanes)` is the
wall time of that work spread over `lanes` concurrent readers. The numbers in Lesson 11 come out of it.
