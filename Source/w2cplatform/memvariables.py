# ================================================================================================
# # memvariables.py — `memory://`, the second backend, and what having two of them proves
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 3 said the store is a URL and nothing in the platform may know which
# backend answers it. That is a claim about design, and a design claim with one implementation is a hope.
# This is the second implementation: the same five clauses, in memory, in fifty lines.
#
# It is not a mock and it is not test scaffolding. It is registered on the same seam `file://` is, chosen
# the same way (`PLATFORM_STORE=memory://`), and held to the same standard — `test_variables_contract.py` runs
# against it unchanged:
#
#     CONTRACT_URL=memory:// python3 tests/run.py
#
# What it is FOR, in order of how often it matters: a dev box where nothing should survive a restart; a
# test that wants the real store and not a fake of it; and М11, where `FakeVariables` is this same thing
# with raft's answers — which is the point. A fake that implements a contract is a backend.
#
# ## Naming, and why a bare `memory://` is different
# A URL names a store, so two opens of one URL must be one store — as two opens of `file://<dir>` are.
# - `memory://<name>` — one store per name, per process. Three identities in one process (a controller, a
#   console and a worker in one dev binary) open the same name and see each other's writes: sharing an
#   address space is not sharing a writer, and the ACL still holds between them.
# - `memory://` — no name, so nothing to share by: a fresh private store on every open. That is what the
#   contract suite needs, since every clause starts from an empty store.
#
# The named stores live for the life of the process and are never collected. For a dev box and a test that
# is the whole of the requirement; anything that needs them collected wanted `file://`.
#
# ## What it deliberately copies from FileVariables
# Not the implementation — the BEHAVIOUR, down to the details a caller can see: an index is never reused,
# not even by a path that was deleted and came back; `put` checks the ACL and
# `delete` does not; `get` of an absent path is `(None, 0)`; a bad path is refused by `safe_path` before
# anything else happens. Where those differ, the contract suite is what says so — which is the entire
# argument for having written the suite before the second backend.
#
# And the ACL is the HANDLE's, as it is in `FileVariables` (the review's second pass, m3). It lived on the
# shared state, so `as_writer` on one handle widened or narrowed what every other handle of the same name
# might write: a worker opening `memory://dev` with its own prefixes rewrote the console's. A handle is an
# identity, and what an identity may write is its own to carry.
