# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # reconciler.py — М9 Lesson 6's reconcile loop, copied unchanged: desired persisted, actual derived
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 4's contract with М9. The loop that turns a list of desired camera rows
# into `start`/`restart`/`stop` calls on an actuator, with backoff on failure and a `converged | lagging |
# stalled` status per camera. It is copied here *unchanged* on purpose: the same `>=` on revision, the same
# stop loop over what is RUNNING, the same jitter, so М9's seven tests (`tests/test_lesson4_worker.py`,
# tests 1–7) run against it without a change of meaning. It knows nothing about epochs, leases, slots or the
# store — `worker.py` wraps it: `VmsWorker` is its `Store` (`desired()` returns the rows of the assignment)
# and `VmsWorker._actuate` is its `Actuator` (the gate that takes an epoch and checks the lease before the
# real actuator). "Desired state is persisted. Actual state is derived."
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `CONVERGED, LAGGING, STALLED = "converged", "lagging", "stalled"` — the three positions `status()`
#   reports; the worker copies them into its heartbeat as `position`.
# - `Store` (Protocol) — anything with `desired() -> list[dict]`; the rows must carry `id`, `enabled`,
#   `revision`.
# - `Actuator` — `Callable[[verb, cam], bool]`: `start` / `restart` / `stop` with the row (`stop` gets only
#   `{id}`); True on success.
#
# ## Notes
# - The loop never sleeps or schedules itself: "nothing supervises the loop, because the loop is the
#   process" — `VmsWorker.run` calls `reconcile` on its poll.
# - A `restart` keeps the camera in `actual` only if the actuator succeeds; `VmsWorker._actuate` reuses the
#   held epoch on a restart so an edit does not fence anything
#   (`test_worker_runs_its_assignment_and_takes_an_epoch_per_camera`: a restart keeps epoch 1).

# {n, retry_at, delay}}`), `max_backoff` (60 s), `stall_failures` (3).

    # revision behind), and on success record the revision and clear the failure, on failure `_fail` and
    # record `("failed", id)`. Then the stop loop walks `actual` — what is RUNNING — and stops anything no
    # longer desired (disabled or deleted), removing it from `actual`. Returns the actions in order. Tests
