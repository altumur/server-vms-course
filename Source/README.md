# Source — the course's code, one root; М10, whole: the platform's shape on one box

The eleven lessons as one runnable package. No scheduler, no KVS, no database: two stores on disk, a controller that is the only writer, a worker that is DriverPack and holds the camera, a recorder that is the only writer of footage, into volumes of ObjectStorage through the host's `obsd` — and three more subsystems through the same platform, which proves it knows nothing about video.

```
Source/
  w2cplatform/                 the platform (named so because Python owns `platform`)
    variables.py               Lesson 1  a config store with ModifyIndex and check-and-set, as files; one writer per prefix
    memvariables.py            Lesson 20  the same contract in memory, registered as `memory://` — the second backend, and
                               what the contract suite is FOR (CONTRACT_URL=memory:// python3 tests/run.py)
    objects.py                 Lesson 1  an object store: a directory
    epoch.py                   Lesson 1  the fencing-token issuer and the lease — generic
    contract.py                Lesson 1  Subsystem, Assignment, Heartbeat, Slot; the Controller and Worker bases; identity by claim
    events.py                  Lesson 3  the event log: buckets per unit per epoch on the resource, for any subsystem — generic
    resource.py                Lesson 3  the resource as a platform job: heartbeat, buckets over HTTP, retention by each subsystem's row, the mirror to a peer, restore
    eventdatabase.py           Lesson 10  EventIndex — a resource's own buckets, read where they lie, with a bounded cache; MergedIndex — what a console has instead: every live resource's /events, merged
    longpoll.py                М10B L25  a hint the reader pulls: Watch — the requests a resource holds until a watched line is appended (GET /events/wait);
                               LongPoll — one held request per resource; Wake — a loop's early pass, never sooner than a quarter of a second
    spec.py                    Lesson 6  the controller as data: SubsystemSpec (rows, fields, derived rows, placement by name — requires, servers, near — snapshot, the two ACLs) and SpecController, the one controller every subsystem runs
    console.py                 Lesson 7  the console as data: SpecConsole over the same spec — the page, /spec, /<rows>, /where, /metrics with the subsystem's prefix, /marks, the writes with the spec's refusals; a subsystem registers extra routes;
                               Mount — one process fronting several subsystems, the root at / and the others under their names (/live/…, /det/…)
    secrets.py                 Lesson 23  the `*_secret` rule: mask_secrets on the way out of the console, and a spec that
                               names a secret in its snapshot does not load; an address read as RFC 3986 writes one, and how a
                               subsystem's addresses carry a login besides that from its url field's `secret_in`
    catalog.py                 the specs this process loaded (or `SPEC_DIR` names): which objects are rows, how an address
                               carries a login — what the platform used to know by name (the boundary's step 4)
    host.py, __main__.py       the platform's own processes for any subsystem (the boundary's step 5): `python3 -m w2cplatform
                               controller <sub> | resource` from `SPEC_DIR`, and the loops every controller, console and resource
                               runs — `controller_loop`, `placement_pass`, `step` (said once a spell), `sweep_loop`, `run_resource`
    console.html               Lesson 7  the one page for every subsystem: reads /spec, builds the list and the forms from the fields; timeline and player only when the spec says media
  vms/                         the VMS — the first subsystem
    reconciler.py              Lesson 4  М9 Lesson 6's loop, copied unchanged: the contract
    obsd.py                    М10B L6  the client (the VMS's: the platform knows no archive engine) of ObjectStorage's daemon: frames over a unix socket, Session/Volume/Writer/Reader, SMPL samples,
                               archive time; a silence is `Unavailable` after a timeout and is not asked twice
    archive.py                 М10B L7  the course's vocabulary over obsd: streams <recording>/e<epoch> (…/backfill, e0 for a keep's copy), Span,
                               authoritative (the highest epoch owns each stretch), visible_from (retention as a ceiling), ArchiveError (wrong / away / busy),
                               Archive — one volume: open (format at quota), put, finish, seal, a fresh reader per question, spans, samples
    worker.py                  Lesson 4  vmsworker: holds N cameras against an assignment — one connection, one fan-out (live_url) each, events into the resource, no footage; an epoch per camera; a lease; the heartbeat with server, labels and capacity — on a box or in an allocation
    rec.subsystem.yaml         Lesson 5  the FOURTH subsystem, as a spec: recordings named by the operator (id: name — one per archive a camera is written to), retention_days, requires: resource, servers: distinct over place_by: volume — the only one placed on the archive
    recworker.py               Lesson 5  RecWorker: VmsWorker over rec/recordings/*, fed by the worker's tee from the VMS heartbeat — shared memory on the same server, RTSP from another;
                               takes a volume (declared, by hold, or its server's own) and writes into it through obsd under owner rec:<volume>; re-subscribes when the
                               camera's holder moves; serves its volume at its archive door (/timeline, /samples); backfill, backups, keeps into an incidents volume
    volumes.py                 М10B L27  the volumes an operator declares — local, network, backup, edge, incidents — and who may serve which
    card.py                    М10B L26  the camera's card WITHOUT an engine, as the product does it — and the camera's memory as ONE budget in bytes
                               (32 MiB: ring 24, the card's queue 6, two pieces of 1): CamRing (one ring, a window of 60 s, `reach()` at the bitrate it is given),
                               CardBuffer (segment files with a byte budget, oldest deleted, an open segment a stream, a range reader that hands over pieces
                               and raises), CardActuator (hold, keep by recording, a queue in bytes that drops to the next key frame, the ring taken a piece
                               at a time, a recording that goes on from where it stopped), CardRecorder (RecWorker's gate over the card; a failing card closed,
                               said and opened again; `card.prebuffer.short`)
    vms.subsystem.yaml         Lesson 6  the VMS's controller, as a spec: cameras numbered, seven operator fields, vms/retention/<cam> derived, labels-subset placement, requires: resource (for its events), the snapshot
    controller.py              Lesson 6  vmscontroller: the platform's SpecController run from the spec, in the VMS's words (create_camera, cameras)
    console.py                 Lesson 7  the console, its own process with its own token (the operator's rows, never placement): SpecConsole plus the VMS's media routes —
                               /timeline/<cam> from every recorder's door, /export/<cam> (an interval as fMP4), and the WHEP door /whep/<cam> that creates a fan-out
                               on the first viewer and proxies to its gateway
    live.subsystem.yaml        Lesson 8  the SECOND subsystem, as a spec: live fan-outs named by camera, placed on gateways by viewer headroom, labels for where viewers are
    det.subsystem.yaml         Lesson 9  the THIRD subsystem, as a spec: one model on one camera, named by the operator, placed on GPU-labelled workers by stream headroom
    detworker.py               Lesson 9  DetWorker: runs a Model against the camera's fan-out, writes what it saw into det/<unit>/e<epoch>/ on the resource under its own epoch —
                               the kinds the row names in `alarms` as alarms (det.alarms/…), `motion` suppressed by the spec's window
    liveworker.py              Lesson 8  LiveWorker, a worker whose unit is a camera's fan-out and whose capacity is viewers: one subscription to the worker's
                               RTSP fan-out (live_url) per camera, N webrtcbin peers behind it, WHEP (POST /whep/<cam>, DELETE /whep/session/<id>), demand-created and demand-deleted units
    resource.py                Lesson 10  the resource process: the platform's Resource with an EventIndex attached and the keeps for bucket retention — events only;
                               the same function М11 runs as the resource job
    config.py                  the schema's Python view over the spec: row() and items()
    __main__.py                python3 -m vms worker | recorder | gateway | detworker | detjobworker | surveyworker | autoworker — the
                               VMS's workers — and controller | console | resource: the platform's loops over the VMS's own controller,
                               console and resource, until their hooks are declarations (the boundary's step 6). The other
                               subsystems' controllers are `python3 -m w2cplatform controller <sub>`
  gstvms/                      Track 2 — needs GStreamer
    uri.py                     Lesson 2  driverpack://file/<name> resolved and refused — pure, no GStreamer
    webrtc.py                  Lesson 8  the gateway's media path (Track 2): rtspsrc ! depay ! parse ! pay ! tee per camera, queue ! webrtcbin per viewer, WHEP without trickle
    livesrv.py                 Lesson 4  FanOut: the worker's RTSP server (GstRtspServer) re-serving each camera's loopback RTP port as rtsp://<server>:8554/<cam> — shared, TCP-interleaved
    driverpacksrc.py           Lesson 2  the element: looping, PTS rebased across the loop
    actuator.py                Lesson 4  GstActuator: driverpacksrc ! h264parse ! watchdog ! tee ! rtph264pay ! udpsink, per camera, published by FanOut; the bus drained into (dead, posted)
                               Lesson 5  GstRecActuator: shmsrc (the worker on this server) or rtspsrc ! rtph264depay (another server), then h264parse ! watchdog ! appsink —
                               each access unit a sample into the volume's writer
  deploy/                      Quadlet, on М9's box: Containerfile (localhost/vmsserver:latest, the image М11 builds FROM), obsd.service (the host's archive engine),
                               vmsworker@.container, recworker@.container (the only writer of footage), vmscontroller.container, reccontroller.container, console.container, w2c-resource.container,

## The Go implementation — the product's

The same contract in Go is the product, `vmssubsystem` (a repository of its own): the same platform, the same
subsystem, the same decisions. **It belongs to the product, not to the course.** The course is written against
this package, and lessons no longer promise that Go has caught up: where they compare the two, they are
describing how the product does it, not a second thing kept in step lesson by lesson.

## What each lesson's deliverable became

| Lesson | Deliverable | Test |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | a config store that survives a restart and refuses a stale CAS; one writer per prefix; the contract a second team could implement; names by claim | `test_lesson1_platform.py` — including *the platform knows nothing about video* (no import from `vms/`, and not the word) and *identity by claim* (two claims, a lapse inherited, a release, the scheduler's index) |
| 2 | `driverpacksrc` running for an hour with monotonic PTS; the refusal of a vendor URI | `test_lesson2_driverpacksrc.py` — the URI logic here; the element and the hour on a box with GStreamer |
| 3 | the archive is a volume: streams named by recording and epoch, readable once their block closes, a fenced epoch on the timeline, retention as a ceiling, events still buckets on the resource | `test_obsd.py` — the engine's properties against a live daemon; `test_lesson3_archive.py` — the stream grammar, `seal`, the fenced epoch across two volumes, the retention ceiling, two writers for one camera |
| 4 | М9's four failures against the worker with its tests passing unchanged; the zombie on one box | `test_lesson4_worker.py` — М9 Lesson 6's seven, then the assignment, the epoch per camera, `live_url` in the heartbeat, the restart with the controller stopped, a nameless replacement inheriting the lapsed slot, the zombie fenced at the slot, the reassignment that is not one |
| 5 | *Record* pressed; the stream `1/e1` in the server's volume; the worker moved and the recorder re-subscribed under `e2`; *Stop recording* | `test_lesson5_recorder.py` — the recording placed on the archive (`requires: resource`, `servers: distinct`) beside the camera's worker (`near: vms`, the reason saying so) and fed from its tee through shared memory, or over RTSP when placed away from it, under the recorder's epoch, the frames landing in its volume while the resource's tree stays events-only, a restart writing a second stream and overwriting nothing, the re-subscription on failover, the recording that waits while nobody holds the camera, the toggle turned off |
| 6 | one box, one controller; the controller stopped, the worker killed, the cameras held again | `test_lesson6_controller.py` — refusals, stored placement by the capacity each worker reports, adding a worker moves nothing, two controllers agree, scale-in redistributed and a crash left alone, the failure arithmetic |
| 7 | the console as its own process; a camera added, edited, recorded, played, deleted from the page; two consoles answering one retry | `test_lesson6_controller.py::test_the_console_over_http` and `…is_one_camera` — the whole surface on a real port, a retry across two consoles; `test_lesson9_det.py::test_one_console_mounts_every_subsystem_it_fronts` |
| 8 | press *Live*; fifty tabs, one subscription; a gateway killed, the next offer answered by the survivor | `test_lesson8_live.py` — the first viewer creates the fan-out and the controller places it, fifty viewers one subscription and the worker unchanged, the grace period and the gateway deleting its own unit, a dead gateway's fan-outs moved to the survivor, placement by label, two subsystems sharing the platform |
| 9 | a model added to the camera from the page, its events beside the VMS's on the resource | `test_lesson9_det.py` — a model placed on the GPU worker and writing its own buckets under its epoch, a camera that stops leaving the model waiting, the unplaceable model placed when a GPU arrives, three subsystems' events on one camera's timeline through the console's index and fenced by their own epochs |
| 10 | three subsystems' events on one timeline through the resource process and the console; the database rebuilt to the same rows; retention taking the rows with the file | `test_lesson10_events.py` |
| 11 | the box: ten units, one image, an update that records nothing rolled back | `test_deploy_units.py` — the Quadlet units against the package: entrypoints, `/data` volumes, the mounts as the ACL, the image's contents |

## The three lines the code holds

**The controller is never on the recovery path.** `test_restart_with_the_controller_stopped` deletes the controller object, starts a fresh worker under the same name, and asserts it holds its cameras again — from its assignment, with the next epoch for each; the recorder re-subscribes to the new fan-out the same way, from the heartbeat.

**The controller never decides how many workers there are.** It has no scheduler client and no `count`. `test_scale_in_releases_a_slot_and_the_controller_redistributes` shows the only thing it does about worker numbers: moving the cameras of a slot whose holder *said* it was stopping — and leaving a merely silent one alone for Nomad. The workers export `headroom`; `/metrics` serves it; whoever runs `count` reads it.

**The platform knows nothing about video.** `test_the_platform_knows_nothing_about_video` greps `w2cplatform/` — `events.py` included — for an import from `vms/` and for the word *camera*.

## Verified where

The suite runs on the author's machine against obsd built from the ObjectStorage sources. `gstvms/` — the element, the two actuators and the RTSP fan-out — is written to GStreamer's Python binding and not exercised here; the logic it calls (`vms.archive.Archive` against a live daemon, the URI resolution) is. The hour-long PTS run, `kill -9` mid-recording, and the zombie with two real worker processes are the box's.
