# them: it does not know the `[Container]` section and ignores the file. The Podman Quadlet generator's dry
# run is the tool — it parses every unit in a directory and prints the generated `.service` units, failing
# on anything it cannot translate. Runs on the bench or in CI (`deploy/check-quadlet.sh`); needs podman's
# generator on the box. Exit codes: `0` when every unit generates; the generator's own non-zero status on a
# bad unit (`set -e`); `2` when there is no generator here, with a message on stderr saying to run it on the
# bench or in CI. `tests/test_deploy_units.py` is the counterpart that runs without podman: it parses the
# units itself and checks them against the package.
