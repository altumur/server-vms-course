"""The contract every Variables backend must keep — one suite, any backend.

A store is swapped by changing `PLATFORM_STORE`,
which is only safe if "it works" means something checkable. This is that meaning:
`file://` on a box, `configstore://` — our own store replicated by raft — in М11's
cluster, Kubernetes when there is a site for it. A new backend is accepted when
this file is green against it, not when it looks right: `test_configstore.py`
runs every clause against a group of one and of three, `test_configstorevars.py`
against the daemon's socket, `test_storemachine.py` against the bare machine.

Run against another backend by pointing `CONTRACT_URL` at it:

    CONTRACT_URL=configstore:///tmp/cs/admin.sock python3 tests/run.py

The contract, in eight clauses:

1.  a key that was never written reads as `(None, 0)`;
2.  `put` returns an index that identifies the version; the next read gives it back;
3.  `cas` is the whole of the concurrency story: N racers, one winner, N-1 refusals;
4.  a writer may only write its own prefixes, and is refused — not ignored — elsewhere;
5.  the index is OPAQUE. It is compared for equality and nothing else, because
    Kubernetes' `resourceVersion` is a string and arithmetic on it is meaningless.
    Clause 5 is the one that quietly decides whether the k8s backend is possible.
6.  a key has exactly ONE spelling: `..` and a leading `/` are REFUSED, not repaired.
7.  what a read hands back is a COPY. A caller that mutates it must not have edited
    the store — an edit without an index is the one thing CAS exists to prevent, and a
    backend that returns its own state gives it away for free.
8.  the store SAYS what it can hold (`max_bytes`, 0 meaning no ceiling), and a write over
    that is refused, not truncated. Nomad caps a Variable at 64 KiB and the platform has no
    say in it; before this clause that number lived in prose, `FileVariables` accepted
    anything, and a write that production would reject was green in every test.
