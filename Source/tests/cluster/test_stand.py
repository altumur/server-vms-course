"""The traces the lessons quote are records of runs, and they stay that way.

`tests/cluster/stand.py` runs each scene of the module's story on the traced stand; the full traces are stored in
`Source/traces/`. This test runs every scene again and compares. When the code changes what it asks
of the store, this fails — and the lesson that quotes the trace is the next thing to update, with
`python3 tests/cluster/stand.py --write`.
