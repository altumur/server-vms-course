"""A field too big for a row: the bytes in the object store, the digest in the row.

Some units carry one opaque lump — a detector's per-pixel mask, a panel's
firmware, a model. It belongs to exactly one unit, the platform never reads
inside it, and it does not belong in a row: a row is small, and a store may
say how small (Nomad's Variables said 64 KiB; `limits.py`), while a per-pixel
mask for 1920x1080 is 345 KB as base64.

Moving such configuration wholesale into the object store is the obvious fix
and the wrong one: an object has no CAS, no one writer and no `revision`, so
the reconciler never learns it changed. These tests are about the shape that
keeps the mechanism — the row holds a DIGEST, and everything else follows from
that one choice.
