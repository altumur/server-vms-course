"""Lesson 9 — an edit for a cluster that is off.

Lesson 3 forwarded an edit to the owning cluster and, when that cluster did not answer, said 503: *could not
look*. That is right for a server room, which is rarely wholly unreachable, and wrong for a camera, which is
one device and is off often — power, a PoE switch, maintenance, a remote site. And cameras are edited in bulk.

So the domain KEEPS the edit: per field, the value it last saw and the value wanted, in the domain holder's
Variables beside the grants. The cluster's own agent carries it home when the cluster comes back, and the
cluster's own console applies it — as the operator, with that operator's grant checked then, and only where
the field still holds the value the edit was based on. The owner never changes; one writer per key stands.
