"""The ceiling a store declares, and what the platform does when a write is over it.

Before this, a store's ceiling lived in prose. `FsObjectStore`
accepted anything, so a write that production would reject was green here, and
the platform found its ceiling the way you find a ceiling in the dark — the
snapshot (Lesson 25) was found by arithmetic on paper, not by a failing test.

Now the store says what it can hold and refuses more. These tests build stores
that DO have a ceiling, which is the only way the refusal is observable on one
box.
