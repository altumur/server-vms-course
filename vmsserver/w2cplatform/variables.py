"""A config store with the semantics Nomad Variables promise — a
raft-assigned ModifyIndex, PUT with cas=<index> succeeding only if the index
still matches, a conflict otherwise — on one box, as files.

One JSON file per path under <root>/vars/, one counter file for the index,
one lock. Every write is atomic (write-then-rename) and serialised by the
lock, so two processes on the same box see exactly what two clients of one

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # variables.py — a file-backed config store with the semantics of Nomad Variables: ModifyIndex,
# check-and-set, one writer per prefix
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 1's config store. It gives one box exactly what a raft-backed Nomad
# Variables store gives a cluster: every path has a `ModifyIndex`, a `put(cas=<index>)` succeeds only if the
# index still matches and raises `Conflict` otherwise, and a writer identity may be confined to a set of
# prefixes (the ACL policy). Everything in the platform that must be consistent — assignments, placement
# rows, epochs, slots, idempotency keys, unit rows — lives here; bulk or frequent data (heartbeats,
# snapshots, media) goes to `objects.py` instead. The store is a directory: one JSON file per path under
# `<root>/vars/`, one counter file for the index, one lock file. Every write is write-then-rename and
# serialised by an `fcntl` lock, so two processes on the same box see exactly what two clients of one raft
# would: one of them wins the CAS. М11 swaps this class for real Nomad Variables behind the same `Variables`
# Protocol.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `Conflict` — exception: the `cas` index passed to `put`/`delete` did not equal the path's current
#   ModifyIndex. Every CAS loop in the platform (`epoch.next_epoch`, `Controller.write`,
#   `Worker.claim_slot`, `IdempotencyKeys.claim`) catches it and re-reads.
# - `Forbidden` — exception: this writer identity is not allowed to write that path. Raised by `put` when an
#   ACL is set; it is how "one writer per prefix" is enforced mechanically rather than by convention. The
#   console test proves a console token cannot write placement by expecting exactly this.
# - `Variables` — `typing.Protocol` with `get`, `put`, `list`: the interface every consumer types against.
#   `FileVariables` implements it here; М11's Nomad client will too. (Note `delete` is not in the Protocol
#   even though `FileVariables` has it; `IdempotencyKeys.prune` uses it.)
#
# ## Notes
# - Atomicity model: rename is atomic on one filesystem; the lock serialises read-check-write; therefore
#   `put(cas=idx)` is a true compare-and-set. `test_two_processes_one_cas_winner` runs four threads, each
#   with its own `FileVariables`, incrementing a counter by CAS and asserts the final value equals the
#   number of successful writes.
# - `test_the_config_store_survives_a_restart_and_refuses_a_stale_cas` shows a second handle on the same
#   directory reads the same items and index, a stale `cas` raises `Conflict`, and `get("nope")` is `(None,
#   0)`.
# - The ACL check is on the handle, not the file: an unrestricted handle over the same directory can still
#   write anything. The confinement is real only when each process gets only its own token — which is what
#   the Quadlet units under `deploy/` arrange.

# it back unmodified, and does nothing else with it — never orders it, never does arithmetic on it. That is
# not fastidiousness, it is what a backend needs. Nomad's `ModifyIndex` is the raft index and is a number;
# Kubernetes' `resourceVersion` is a string, and its API conventions require it: "This value MUST be treated
# as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server" — it is "currently backed by etcd's
# mod_revision", but an application "should *not* rely on the implementation details of the versioning
# system". Typing this `int` would have made a Kubernetes backend bet on that detail.
#
# One value is NOT a version and is the same everywhere: `0` means the path does not exist. `get` returns it
# for a missing path, and `put(cas=0)` therefore means "create only" — the first claimant wins and everyone
# else conflicts (`SpecController.create`, `IdempotencyKeys.claim`).
