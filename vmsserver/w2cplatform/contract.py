"""The subsystem contract — what the platform knows about any subsystem,
and it is all of this:

    a config prefix        <name>/*                      writable by the controller only
    assignment rows        <name>/workers/<worker>       what each worker should run
    a heartbeat object     <name>/<worker>/heartbeat     {ts, status: [...]} — the worker's own report
    an epoch prefix        <name>/epoch/<unit>           fencing tokens the workers take by CAS
    an event log           <resource>/<name>/<unit>/e<epoch>/<start>Z.events.jsonl   (w2cplatform.events)
                                                         what a worker observed about a unit it holds the epoch for;
                                                         on its server's resource, under the subsystem's prefix
    a slot prefix          <name>/slots/<worker>         identity by claim: a worker's name is a slot it
                                                         holds by CAS and renews; a replacement process
                                                         takes the lapsed slot and inherits its assignment

Who decides how many workers there are: not the controller. The scheduler
runs `count` of them (Nomad, or `systemctl start vmsworker@w-N` on one box)
and an autoscaler moves `count` from a headroom metric the workers export.
The platform's part is to give `count` interchangeable processes stable
names — the slots — so that assignments survive a reschedule. A slot is
released on an orderly stop (scale-in); the controller then redistributes
what the slot held. A slot that merely lapses (a crash) is left alone: the
scheduler brings the process back, and it claims the same slot.

`Controller` and `Worker` are the two base classes. The platform never
imports anything from a subsystem; the live and det subsystems prove the
shape is generic by running a subsystem that counts seconds through it.

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # contract.py — the subsystem contract: Subsystem, Assignment, Heartbeat, Slot, and the Controller and
# Worker base classes
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 1. This file is the whole of what the platform knows about any subsystem,
# and it is deliberately small: a config prefix `<name>/*` writable by the controller only; assignment rows
# `<name>/workers/<worker>`; a heartbeat object `<name>/<worker>/heartbeat`; an epoch prefix
# `<name>/epoch/<unit>` the workers take by CAS; an event log on the resource (`events.py`); and a slot
# prefix `<name>/slots/<worker>` — identity by claim. It depends on `variables.py`, `objects.py` and
# `epoch.py` and nothing else. `spec.SpecController` extends `Controller`; `vms.worker.VmsWorker` and the
# gateway (`vms/liveworker.py`) and the detector (`vms/detworker.py`) extend `Worker`. The file's own docstring settles who
# decides how many workers there are: not the controller. The scheduler runs `count` of them; the platform's
# part is to give those interchangeable processes stable names — the slots — so assignments survive a
# reschedule. A slot released on an orderly stop is redistributed by the controller; a slot that merely
# lapses is a crash, left alone for the scheduler.
#
# ## Module-level names
# None (dataclasses and classes only).
#
# ### `__init__(self, sub, name, vars_, objects, lease_ttl=30.0, lease_margin=5.0, clock=time.monotonic,
# wall=time.time, instance=None, slot_ttl=45.0)` `name` is the slot name, or `None` until `claim_slot()`.
# `instance` identifies the process (`hostname:pid:6hex` by default) and is what a slot row records as
# `holder`. Keeps two clocks: monotonic for leases, wall for slot expiry. `epochs` and `leases` are per-unit
# dicts, empty at start.
#
# ## Notes
# - The tests enforce the boundary: `test_the_platform_knows_nothing_about_video` asserts no import from
#   `vms/` and not the word "camera" in this file; `test_lesson8_live.py` and `test_lesson9_det.py` run two more subsystems through the
#   same `Controller`/`Worker`.
# - Ordering that matters: a worker claims its slot before reading its assignment (the name is the row key);
#   it takes an epoch before writing anything for a unit; it renews slot and leases on a shorter period than
#   `slot_ttl` / `lease_ttl − margin`.
# - `until` is wall-clock while leases are monotonic: slots are compared across processes and boxes, leases
#   only within one process.

    #
    # Order matters and is the caller's: it passes candidates in the order it wants them taken (a
    # recorder puts its own server's disks before a network archive any box could serve). A `Conflict`
    # means somebody took this one between the read and the write — try the next candidate, and only
    # repeat the sweep if contention was the reason we ran out.
    #
    # THE PLACE FOLLOWS THE NAME (feedback CF). A recorder killed and started again by systemd is the same
    # worker: it takes its slot back at once, from a holder that has not lapsed (`claim_slot(prefer=…)` —
    # М10B Lesson 17: systemd is the authority on which process is the current `r-1`). Its volume did not
    # follow: the hold waited out its TTL — 45 s in which nothing on that volume was recorded, by the very
    # process that held it a moment ago. So a hold says WHOSE slot holds it (`by`), and the worker of that
    # slot takes it back at once, before any other candidate. The previous instance finds out at its next
    # `renew_hold` and stops writing there; what it wrote in between is fenced by the new epochs, as a slot's is.
    # Anybody else still waits for the TTL — the product's own lesson, from its archive daemon: a place
    # kept for its owner must be kept LONGER than the time the owner takes to come back.
    #
    # THE TTL BY THIS HOST'S CLOCK (the review's fourth pass, Т-M5). Anybody else took a hold when the wall clock HERE
    # passed the `until` the holder wrote by ITS wall clock: two machines five seconds apart, and a holder renewing
    # every pass looked lapsed to its neighbour — two writers in one ring, which on s3 the engine's lock does not
    # reliably stop. So a hold of somebody else's is stale when THIS process has watched its row stand still — the
    # same revision, never renewed — for the hold's whole term and `HOLD_SKEW` on top, by its own monotonic clock.
    # A holder that renews changes the row every pass, whatever its clock says; one that stopped leaves it standing.
    # The price: a process that first looks at a long-dead hold waits one term from that look. A released hold, or
    # one nobody holds, is free at once, as before.
    #
    # And no generation in the daemon's `owner` (`rec:<volume>`, `Archive`). The owner is how the next holder of the
    # volume on this host picks up the writer a vanished one left, detached — with a generation in it the successor
    # names another owner, and waits out the daemon's grace with nothing recorded, which is what the owner is there
    # to prevent (feedback CF). The fence is the hold, confirmed by CAS right before every `VOLUME_MOUNT_RW`
    # (`RecWorker._confirm_hold`); on one host the daemon itself keeps one writer per volume.
