"""The platform, on one box (the package is `w2cplatform` only because Python owns the name `platform`). Everything here would host any fleet of
stateless shards writing bulk data; nothing here knows what a camera is.

    variables.py   a small, consistent config store with ModifyIndex and check-and-set (file-backed)
    objects.py     an object store (a directory)
    epoch.py       the fencing-token issuer and the lease, generic
    contract.py    what a subsystem gives the platform: a controller and its workers
    spec.py        the controller as data: SubsystemSpec from <sub>.subsystem.yaml, SpecController
    console.py     the console as data: SpecConsole over the same spec; console.html, the one page
    events.py, eventdatabase.py, resource.py   buckets, the event index each resource reads its own by, the resource job

М11 replaces variables.py with Nomad Variables and objects.py with MinIO,
behind the same interfaces, and changes nothing above this line.

# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # __init__.py — the package docstring: what `w2cplatform` is and what each module holds
#
# **Role in the module.** The file contains no code, only the package docstring. It names the package
# (`w2cplatform` rather than `platform` because Python's standard library already owns `platform`), states
# the one design line that governs everything under it — *nothing here knows what a camera is*; anything
# here would host any fleet of stateless shards writing bulk data — and gives a one-line map of the modules:
# `variables.py` (config store with ModifyIndex and check-and-set), `objects.py` (object store), `epoch.py`
# (fencing token and lease), `contract.py` (Controller and Worker bases), `spec.py` (the controller as
# data), `console.py` and `console.html` (the console as data), and `events.py` / `eventdatabase.py` /
# `resource.py` (buckets, the index over them, the resource job).
#
# The docstring also fixes the boundary the next module (М11) will use: М11 replaces `variables.py` with
# Nomad Variables and `objects.py` with MinIO *behind the same interfaces* (the `Variables` and
# `ObjectStore` Protocols) and changes nothing above that line.
#
# ## Module-level names
# None. There are no imports either, so `import w2cplatform` pulls in nothing; each module is imported
# explicitly (`from w2cplatform.spec import SpecController`).
#
# ## Notes
# - `tests/test_lesson1_platform.py::test_the_platform_knows_nothing_about_video` greps every `.py` under
#   this directory for `from vms` / `import vms`, and every file except this `__init__.py` for the word
#   "camera" in any case. This file is exempt from the word check only because its docstring says "nothing
#   here knows what a camera is"; it still must not import from `vms/`.
