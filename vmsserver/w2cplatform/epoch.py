# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # epoch.py — the fencing-token issuer and the lease, generic to any writer that can have two instances
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 1. A unit (a camera, a fan-out, a model) may at any moment have two processes
# believing they run it — a zombie after a reschedule, or a reassignment window. The platform's answer is a
# fencing token, the *epoch*: a per-unit integer that comes from one issuer (the CAS on a Variables key) and
# only increases. Whoever holds the newest epoch is the writer; an older holder discovers it on its next
# renewal and stops. This file has the issuer (`next_epoch`), the reader (`current_epoch`) and the lease
# that a holder keeps on its epoch (`Lease`). The subsystem decides the key (`Subsystem.epoch_key(unit)`
# gives `<name>/epoch/<unit>`); the platform promises only that numbers come from one issuer, in order.
# `contract.Worker.take_epoch` and `renew_leases` are the callers; `vms.archive` puts the epoch in every
# segment and bucket path so a stale writer's output is identifiable afterwards.
#
# ## Module-level names
# None.
#
# ## Notes
# - `test_lease_on_a_monotonic_clock`: at 24.9 s the lease may write; at 25.1 s it may not and
#   `seconds_left() == 0`; a successful `renew()` restores it; after someone else calls `next_epoch` on the
#   same key, `renew()` returns False, `fenced` is set and `conflicts == 1`.
# - The fence is discovered at renewal, never pushed: a zombie keeps writing for at most `ttl − margin`
#   after the new holder took the epoch. That bounded window is the RPO the archive lesson accepts, and the
#   epoch in the path is what lets the manifest mark that window as fenced afterwards.

# times, then raise `RuntimeError`. Because the CAS is on the row's index, two callers racing get two
# different numbers in order and no number is ever reused — `test_epoch_issuer_never_reuses_a_number` runs
# four threads issuing 25 each and asserts the set is exactly 1..100. The returned index is the row's
