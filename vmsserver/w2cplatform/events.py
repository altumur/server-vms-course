"""The event log — a platform piece. What the platform knows about events,
and it is all of this:

    a bucket    <resource>/<subsystem>/<unit>/e<epoch>/<start>Z.events.jsonl
                JSON lines {t, kind, ...}, for a span of `bucket_seconds` starting at <start>
    its writer  the worker that holds that unit's epoch — one writer per file, by construction
    its fence   the epoch in the path: a stale instance writes into its own bucket, marked afterwards
    its index   the manifest beside the unit's buckets, and (М11) a cluster-wide cache over every resource

Nothing here knows what a unit is. The VMS's unit has footage and its
bucket sits beside it; a detector's unit is a model; a gateway's
unit is a fan-out. The word "event" means only: something a worker
observed at a time, about a unit it holds.

# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # events.py — the event log: JSON-lines buckets per unit per epoch on the resource, for any subsystem
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 3. An event here means only "something a worker observed at a time, about a
# unit it holds the epoch for". The platform fixes the shape and nothing else: a bucket is `<resource
# root>/<subsystem>/<unit>/e<epoch>/<start>Z.events.jsonl`, holding JSON lines `{t, kind, ...}` for a span
# of `bucket_seconds` starting at `<start>`; its writer is the worker holding that unit's epoch (one writer
# per file by construction); its fence is the epoch in the path (a stale instance writes into its own
# bucket, which is marked afterwards); its index is the manifest beside the unit's buckets (the VMS's, in
# `vms/archive.py`) and `eventdatabase.py` on each resource. `resource.py` walks these paths for retention
# and mirroring; `console.py` uses `EventLog` for operator marks under `console/<instance>/`; the VMS worker
# uses it per camera. Nothing here knows what a unit is.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `EVENTS` — regex for a bucket filename: `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.events.jsonl`.
# - `EPOCH_DIR` — regex for the epoch directory: `e<digits>`.
#
# ## Notes
# - `test_lesson3_archive.py::test_events_are_buckets_on_the_resource_recording_or_not` and
#   `test_lesson4_worker.py::test_the_worker_observes_what_it_holds_recording_or_not` exercise the VMS's use
#   of this file: buckets are written whether or not media is recorded, closed buckets are counted onto the
#   timeline, and a fenced epoch's bucket is marked, not deleted.
# - A bucket is "closed" when `end <= now`; only closed buckets are mirrored and indexed
#   (`resource.Resource.closed_buckets`). The open one is the accepted loss on a disk failure.

#
# The class is a FIELD, declared and refused, and deliberately not a convention on `kind`. A convention
# refuses nothing: it reads whatever is written and quietly excludes a typo, and the exclusion shows up
# months later as an alarm nobody was shown. This is the same reason `keep` is refused rather than read
# leniently (Lesson 13) and a suppression rule is refused at load (above).
#
# Two is a decision, not a placeholder. A class earns its place by having a POLICY that differs, and
# today exactly one does: when a window overflows its limit, observations are dropped before alarms
# (`eventdatabase.query`). A third class with no policy of its own would be a word in a file.
#
# Which lines are alarms is NOT settled here, and not in a subsystem's spec either: the same `io.input` is
# an alarm on a door contact and noise on a technological sensor, and the difference is how the device was
# wired, not what the event type is. So the platform fixes the vocabulary and refuses anything outside it;

# ==================================================================================================
# A storm of events is NORMAL, not a fault: a contact bouncing, a link flapping, a sensor re-reporting
# for as long as the thing it watches keeps happening. Nothing downstream can undo one — an index reads
# what is written, a timeline draws what it reads, and every reader that tried to collapse repeats would
# do it its own way and disagree with the others. The one place a repeat can be recognised BEFORE it costs anything is the
# process holding the unit's epoch, one line before `append`.
#
# Two things make suppression honest rather than a quiet loss of data:
#
#   1. The FIRST line of a window is written immediately and unchanged. Whatever the repeats are
#      worth, the first occurrence is the observation, and delaying it to batch it would trade the
#      one property an alarm has for a smaller file.
#   2. What was dropped is SAID. When the window closes, a summary line carries `repeats`, `since`
#      and `until`, so a quiet log and a suppressed storm are different things on the timeline.
#      Without it suppression is indistinguishable from nothing having happened, which is the failure
#      this whole module is built to avoid (`state`, `truncated`, `unreachable` — Lesson 13).
