"""The console as data — the other half of spec.py. A subsystem's YAML
already says what its units are, which fields the operator owns and what
leaves the cluster; that is everything a console needs to list, edit and
show them. So the console is one class, run from the same spec:

    GET  /                       the page (console.html): the unit list, the edit form built from the spec's fields,
                                 and — when the subsystem registered media routes — a timeline and a player
    GET  /spec                   what the page reads first: name, rows, id rule, fields, media, metric names
    GET  /<rows>                 {rows: the read model from every worker's heartbeat, configured: the units}
    GET  /where/<id>             the stored placement (why) and the assignments' answer (where, one scan)
    GET  /resources              the platform's resources: usage, units, live | silent
    GET  /unplaceable            units nothing live can serve, with the labels that say why
    GET  /servers                every server as placement sees it: its archive (the label), its resource (the fact), its workers, placeable or why not
    GET  /domain                 the domain's view, if THIS cluster hosts the domain (М12 Lesson 3): members, completeness,
                                 units by cluster, with its age; 404 anywhere else — a cluster does not know the others
    GET/PUT /policy              the administrator's knobs — servers: shared | distinct — one row, <sub>/policy, the console's to write
    GET  /events?from&to&unit&kind&subsystem   the resources' event databases, merged (MergedIndex), fenced by every subsystem's epochs
    GET  /metrics                <name>_workers_live · <name>_worker_headroom{worker,server} · <name>_worker_load ·
                                 <name>_epoch_conflicts · <name>_failover_seconds{kind="worst"} · <name>_resources_live ·
                                 <name>_<running> (units in phase "running"; the spec names the gauge)
    POST /<rows>  (Idempotency-Key)   the row only — the controller places it on its next pass; the key is a Variable
                                 (<sub>/idem/<key>), so the retry is answered the same by whichever console gets it
    PUT  /<rows>/<id>            the operator's fields; a new revision; refused where the controller refuses
    DELETE /<rows>/<id>          the row is marked; the controller's pass takes its placement back
    POST /marks  (Idempotency-Key)    an operator's observation {unit|cam, note}: the CONSOLE's event, into
                                 console/<instance>/… on this server's resource — never a worker's bucket

What a subsystem adds is registered, not subclassed: `extra(handler, method,
path, query) -> reply | None` gets every request the routes above do not
claim (the VMS: /timeline and /segment); a reply is `(status, dict)`,
`(status, bytes)`, `(status, bytes, headers)` or `()` when the extra wrote
it itself. The console holds the subsystem's
SpecController with the console's token — the operator's rows, never
placement — so a write it should not make is a 403 from the store, not a
rule in this file.

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # console.py — the console as data: SpecConsole over the same spec, with idempotent writes and the
# subsystem's registered extra routes
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 6, the other half of `spec.py`. A subsystem's YAML already says what its
# units are, which fields the operator owns and what leaves the cluster; that is everything a console needs
# to list, edit and show them, so the console is one class run from the same spec. It serves `console.html`,
# `/spec` (what the page reads first), the rows with the read model, `/where`, `/resources`, `/unplaceable`,
# `/events` (if a `MergedIndex` — anything with `query(t0, t1, cam, kind, subsystem, unit, current_epochs)` — is behind it), `/metrics`, and the writes — POST/PUT/DELETE on the rows and
# POST `/marks` — with idempotency keys stored in Variables so a retry answered by another console instance
# is the same request. What a subsystem adds is registered, not subclassed: `extra(handler, method, path,
# query)` gets every request the built-in routes do not claim (the VMS: `/timeline` and `/segment`). The
# console holds the subsystem's `SpecController` with the *console's* token (the operator's rows, never
# placement), so a write it should not make is a 403 from the store, not a rule in this file.
# `vms/console.py` builds it via `make_console`; the deploy unit `console.container` runs it as its own
# process.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `PAGE` — absolute path of `console.html` beside this file; served at `/`.
#
# ### `__init__(self, ctl, marks_root=None, index=None, worst_failover=0.0, wall=None, extra=None,
# media=False, lost_after=45.0)` `ctl` is the subsystem's `SpecController` holding the console's token;
# `marks_root` is this server's resource root — if given, `self.marks` is an `EventLog(marks_root,
# "console", <hostname:pid>, epoch 1)` (the console's own log; one writer, so epoch 1 forever); `index` is
# an optional `MergedIndex` (anything with `query(...)`); `worst_failover` is a number exported on `/metrics`; `extra` is the subsystem's
# route function; `media` tells the page it may draw a timeline and play. `seen` is the `IdempotencyKeys`
# over `<sub>/idem/`. `_scan` caches the assignment directory; `scans` counts cache refreshes.
#
# ## Notes
# - `test_the_console_over_http` walks the whole surface: POST twice with one key is one camera; the
#   console's controller cannot `place` (`Forbidden`); PUT `{"worker": "w-9"}` is 400; `/cameras` rows show
#   `phase running` and `server srv-1`; `/where/1` agrees with the directory; `/spec` says `rows cameras,
#   media true`; `/metrics` contains `vms_cameras_running 1`; `/marks` writes to `console/<instance>/e1/`;
#   the page mentions `/spec`, `/timeline/`, `/segment/`, `<video>` and never the word camera outside its
#   comment; `/timeline/1` and a ranged `/segment/` come from the VMS extra; PUT `{"enabled": false}` bumps
#   revision to 2; DELETE marks the row and the placement waits for `unplace_deleted`.
# - Idempotency covers POST always, PUT optionally, DELETE never; the page sends a fresh key with every
#   request (including DELETE, where it is ignored).
# - `/events` relies on a `MergedIndex` behind the console — every live resource's own event database, merged; without one it is an honest 503,
#   and the page tolerates that.
