"""eventdatabase — the event "database", which is a cache. Part of the resource job:
one per RESOURCE, over that resource's own tree — its buckets, and the copies
it holds of its peers' closed buckets (`.mirror/<server>/`). Nothing per
console, nothing cluster-wide: a console with a question asks every live
resource's `GET /events` and merges the answers by time (`MergedIndex`), on
one box and on a cluster alike.

Events are observations: written by the worker that holds a unit's epoch,
into that unit's bucket on its server's resource (w2cplatform.events). The
database is a SQLite table the resource job can rebuild entirely by
re-reading its tree. It knows which subsystems exist by the directories it
finds; a new one is indexed the pass after it starts writing, with no change
here. It knows nothing about what an event means: `cam` is a field an event
may carry, indexed if present.

Its two properties are the controller's, in the form that matters here:
it holds nothing it cannot rebuild, and nothing running depends on it.
No controller writes events. A restarted resource says *catching up*
until its rebuild is done rather than answering short.

    EventDatabase(root, server)   the resource job's: rebuilt on start, tailed every few seconds
    rebuild() / tail()            read the tree: closed buckets once, open ones by the lines past what is held
    query(...)                    subsystem, unit, cam (a field an event may carry), kind, time window
    forget(server, paths)         retention removed a bucket: its rows go with it (the resource calls this)
    MergedIndex(objects)          what a console has instead: every live resource's /events, merged

# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # eventdatabase.py — the event "database", which is a cache: one SQLite table per resource, over its own tree
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 10 on the box, Lesson 3 on the cluster: the reader of `events.py`. Events are
# written by workers into per-unit buckets on their server's resource; search needs a database over them,
# and this is it — but one PER RESOURCE, not one per cluster: the resource job runs an `EventDatabase` over
# its own root (own buckets and the `.mirror/<server>/` copies it holds) and answers `GET /events` from it.
# A console asks every live resource and merges (`MergedIndex`) — the box's console asks its one resource,
# М11's asks them all. Nothing crosses the network to build a database, and no job holds every server's
# rows. It discovers subsystems and units from the directories, so a new subsystem is indexed the pass
# after it starts writing, with no change here. It knows nothing about what an event means: `cam` is a
# field an event may carry, indexed if present. Its two properties are the controller's in the form that
# matters here: it holds nothing it cannot rebuild, and nothing running depends on it. No controller writes
# events.
#
# ## Module-level names
# None.
#
# ## Notes
# - The `cam` column exists so a VMS timeline can ask "everything about camera 7 from any subsystem" without
#   the database knowing what a camera is; the console's `/events?cam=` maps onto it.
# - Nothing is ever updated in place: rows are inserted per bucket (an open bucket by the lines past what is
#   held) and deleted per bucket, matching the resource's file-level retention.
# - Rows from a mirror copy are inserted under the REAL owning server and the original path: a query answers
#   "srv-a's events" whichever resource holds them, and the console drops the copy when the owner itself
#   answers.

        unit's own subsystem knows its current epoch; the database just compares.

        `epoch_policy` is {subsystem: "fenced" | "earlier-run"} — what an older epoch MEANS
        there. Same comparison, two meanings: a writer that lost the race, or a finished
        earlier run of work that ends. The database is told; it does not decide.

        `keep` is which END of an overflowing window survives `limit` — and it is the CALLER's
        to choose, because "a thousand of the five thousand" means nothing without it. The
        default is "newest": nearly everything asked of an event log is a form of "what just
        happened", and the reader that wants the other end — paging forward through an archive
        from a cursor — knows that about itself and says so. `LIMIT` with no direction was this
        method dropping the newest end silently, which is the end a timeline and an automation
        scenario are both looking at.

        The answer is ascending by time whichever end was kept, and it carries `truncated`, so a
        decision taken on part of a window cannot look like one taken on all of it.

        `cls` narrows to one traffic class — "show me the alarms of this hour" — and an unknown one
        is refused rather than answered with nothing, because an empty list is what "no alarms
        happened" looks like too.

        And the class earns its existence HERE: when the window overflows, OBSERVATIONS ARE DROPPED
        BEFORE ALARMS. A limit is a budget for a screenful, and spending it on the thousand statistics
        lines that crowded out the one contact that opened is the failure the class was introduced to
        prevent. The ordering costs one clause; leaving it out would make the class a word in a file."""

        The overflow policy is carried both ways for the same reason: each resource kept its alarms
        ahead of its observations, and the merge must do it again over the union, or an alarm that
        survived on its own server is dropped when it meets a busier neighbour's window.

        `truncated` is true if ANY resource cut its answer or the merge cut theirs: the reader is
        told the window is partial, not which server made it partial.

        `complete` is the other half of "is this all of it", and a reader that DECIDES on a window —
        automation moving its cursor past it — needs it: an empty window and a window whose server did not
        answer look the same in `events`. `incomplete` names each server the window is missing, and why:

        `catching up` — a restarted resource rebuilding); or silent, and it could have written inside the

        make it incomplete: a box taken out of service must not hold every reader's window for ever.
