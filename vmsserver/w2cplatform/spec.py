"""The controller as data. A subsystem gives the platform a spec — one YAML
file — and the platform runs the controller from it:

    name          the prefix: <name>/*
    unit          the rows: where they live (<name>/<rows>/<id>), how an id is made (numeric | <field>),
                  the operator's fields with types and defaults, and derived rows (a second row the
                  platform keeps beside the unit — the VMS's <name>/retention/<id> that the resource reads)
    placement     capacity and headroom as heartbeat fields; a constraint and a tie-break BY NAME from
                  the catalogue below — never an expression; `requires: resource` when a worker must
                  run where a resource answers (not placed on, moved off, while it is silent); the
                  rebalance dead band
    snapshot      the fields that leave the cluster, as one object for the layer above

The catalogue is deliberately short. `labels-subset`: a unit's `labels` must
be a subset of what the worker's server reports. `most-free-capacity`: the
worker with the most capacity − load wins. A subsystem that needs another
rule registers a function under a name (`register_constraint`), which is the
same door the resource opens for its hooks — code, named, not YAML pretending
to be code.

What is NOT in a spec: anything about what a unit does. That is the worker,
and the worker is the subsystem.

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # spec.py — the controller as data: SubsystemSpec from `<sub>.subsystem.yaml`, and SpecController, the one
# controller every subsystem runs
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 6. A subsystem gives the platform one YAML file and the platform runs its
# controller from it. The spec says: `name` (the prefix `<name>/*`); `unit` (where rows live —
# `<name>/<rows>/<id>` — how an id is made — `numeric` or a field name — the operator's fields with types
# and defaults, and derived rows kept beside the unit, such as the VMS's `vms/retention/<id>` that the
# resource reads); `placement` (which heartbeat fields carry capacity and headroom, a constraint and a
# tie-break chosen *by name* from a short catalogue — never an expression — `requires: resource` when the
# worker's server must have a resource that answers, and the rebalance dead band);
# `snapshot` (the fields that leave the cluster); `console` (the name of the running gauge). What is not in
# a spec: anything about what a unit does — that is the worker, and the worker is the subsystem.
# `SpecController` extends `contract.Controller` and adds units, placement, redistribution, rebalance, the
# read model and the snapshot. `vms/controller.py` is this class with the VMS's spec and VMS names for the
# methods; `vms/config.py` exposes `row()`/`items()`; `console.py` runs over the same spec.
# `tests/test_lesson8_live.py` and `tests/test_lesson9_det.py` run two more subsystems through it from their own YAML.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `PLATFORM_FIELDS = ("worker", "placement", "epoch", "revision", "observed_revision", "phase", "id")` —
#   never the operator's. `SubsystemSpec.refuse` rejects any of them in a create/update body: placement is
#   decided and stored by the controller with a reason; revision, epoch and phase are not the operator's.
# - `SpecController.POLICY_DEFAULTS` / `POLICY_CHOICES` — the administrator's knobs, one row `<name>/policy`
#   written by the console (`acl_console` includes it) and read by the controller on every pass: `servers`
#   is `shared` (default: every worker carries units, two on one server included — a box is that; a dead
#   server's slot is the scheduler's to reschedule onto a neighbour) or `distinct` (one worker per server
#   carries units, `idle_by_policy` names the rest; a server whose worker and resource are both silent is
#   gone, `gone_servers`, and its units move). The jobspec says `spread`, so both are possible without
#   touching Nomad.
# - `CONSTRAINTS` — the catalogue: `"none"` (always eligible) and `"labels-subset"` (`_labels_subset`).
#   `requires: resource` is not a constraint on the unit but on the worker's server: `resource_state` reads
#   `platform/resources/<server>/heartbeat` — `live`, `silent`, or `unknown` (never seen) — and `_pool`
#   drops workers whose resource is silent; `redistribute` moves their units off with the reason
#   `resource on <server> silent`. Nomad's `meta.archive` puts a worker where disks are declared; this is
#   whether the resource there still answers. `unknown` passes: silent is a fact, unknown is not one.
#   Extended only by `register_constraint`.
#
# ## Notes
# - Every write is `Controller.write` (CAS loop) or a create-only `put(cas=0)`; nothing is cached, so the
#   process can be killed anywhere.
# - The order inside `place` — placement row, then assignment — is what makes two instances agree: the row
#   is the lock.
# - `capacity_of`/`labels_of`/`server_of` call `workers_seen(max_age=1e12)` each time, i.e. one object-store
#   listing per call; correctness over speed, fine on one box.

    # outgrows its worker becomes unplaceable rather than spilling over, because spilling over is the

    # the digest of its bytes, so every edit of a `blob` field makes a NEW permanent object: unlike a
    # heartbeat, whose key is reused by the next instance of the slot, blobs grow with the number of edits
    # over the system's lifetime and nothing ever reclaims them.
    #
    # The obvious implementation is wrong, and it is worth being precise about why. "Delete every blob no
    # row names" races with `put_blob`: the object is written BEFORE the row that names it (Lesson 26), so
    # a sweep landing between those two writes sees an unreferenced blob and deletes the bytes a row is
    # about to point at. The unit then cannot start, and the operator's upload silently did nothing.
    #
    # So noticing and deleting are put in DIFFERENT PASSES:
    #
    #   mark   nothing is deleted. The digests that no row names are written to `<name>/sweep` with the
    #          time. A blob created after this moment is not on the list, which is where the grace period
    #          comes from — no timestamps on objects required, and `variables://` has none to offer.
    #   sweep  one pass later, and only after `grace`: the marked digests are checked AGAIN, the decision is
    #          written by CAS on the index just read — the doomed digests, `state: deleting` — and only then
    #          are the objects removed, each one read back from the row the moment before.
    #
    # The order of those last two is the whole safety argument. Writing the decision first means a lost CAS —
    # anyone touched the row since the mark — costs nothing: not one object has been deleted yet. Deleting
    # first would mean acting on a decision that something has already contradicted.
    #
    # And the decision STAYS on the row while the bytes go (the review's second pass, m5). It used to be
    # cleared first, so a `put_blob` of a marked digest in the seconds the deletes took found an empty list,
    # took nothing off it, and its bytes were removed under a row about to name them. Now it finds the digest
    # there, as before the decision, and takes it off; the sweeper re-reads the row before each delete and
    # leaves what is gone from it alone. The row is cleared at the end, by CAS; a clear that loses — somebody
    # took a digest off meanwhile — leaves the rest listed for the next pass, which checks them again.
    #
    # That left one window, two store calls wide (the review's third pass): the sweeper reads "still doomed",
    # `put_blob` takes the digest off and writes the object, and the sweeper's delete removes it. It is closed by
    # reading the bytes before the delete and the row AFTER it: a digest that left the list in between is one
    # somebody is uploading, and its object is put back — the same bytes, by construction (the key is their
    # digest), so the restore and the upload write one object, in whichever order they land. Still on the list
    # after the delete means `put_blob` has not taken it off yet, and its own write comes after ours.
    #
    # `limit` is not a nicety either: `<name>/sweep` is a row, and a row has the store's ceiling over it
    # (Lesson 26). The sweep is subject to the rule it was written under.
