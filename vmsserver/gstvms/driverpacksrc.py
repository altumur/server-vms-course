"""driverpacksrc — a source element whose URI names what the real DriverPack
will open. In this course: driverpack://file/<name> plays <MEDIA_DIR>/<name>
in a loop, paced by its own timestamps, with PTS rebased across each loop
so the pipeline's running time never goes backwards. That rebasing is the
one non-mechanical part of any source element — the part a real DriverPack
does with a vendor SDK's clock — which is why it is built and tested here.

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # driverpacksrc.py — the source element: a media file played in a loop as if it were a camera, with PTS
# rebased across each loop
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 2, Track 2 (needs `gi`). A GStreamer bin registered as the element
# `driverpacksrc`, whose `uri` property names what the real DriverPack would open. Here
# `driverpack://file/<name>` plays `<MEDIA_DIR>/<name>`, paced by its own timestamps, and on EOS seeks back
# to zero while carrying a running offset forward so the pipeline's running time never goes backwards. The
# docstring says why this file exists at all: the rebasing is "the one non-mechanical part of any source
# element — the part a real DriverPack does with a vendor SDK's clock". Everything downstream (`h264parse`,
# `watchdog`, the recorder's sink) sees one monotonic stream. The Lesson 2 deliverable is this element running for
# an hour with monotonic PTS (README: "the hour on a box with GStreamer"). Used by `actuator.py` through
# `Gst.parse_launch`; try it with `gst-launch-1.0 driverpacksrc uri=driverpack://file/lobby.mp4 ! h264parse
# ! fakesink -v`.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `gi.require_version("Gst", "1.0")`, `Gst.init(None)` — run at import; importing this module initialises
#   GStreamer.
# - The two calls at the bottom, `GObject.type_register(DriverPackSrc)` and `Gst.Element.register(None,
#   "driverpacksrc", Gst.Rank.NONE, DriverPackSrc)`, make the class an element factory by name.
#   `test_the_element_runs_when_gstreamer_is_present` imports the module and asserts
#   `Gst.ElementFactory.make("driverpacksrc")` is not `None`.
#
# ## Notes
# - The `1/25 s` step assumes a 25 fps source; a file at another rate still loops and stays monotonic, only
#   the gap at the seam differs.
# - Nothing here knows about cameras, epochs or the archive: the element is a source. The epoch is the
#   recorder's, in the name of the stream its sink writes.

    # pipeline clock reaches their PTS — this is what makes a file behave like a live camera, and gives a
    # recorder frames at the camera's own pace. Adds two pad probes on the identity's src pad: a BUFFER probe
