# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # actuator.py — the worker's verb → pipeline: `driverpacksrc ! h264parse ! watchdog ! tee ! archivesink`
# per
# camera, the bus drained into (dead, posted)
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 4, Track 2 (needs `gi`). The real actuator `VmsWorker` runs its reconciler
# against when GStreamer is present (`vms/__main__.worker` tries to import it and falls back to
# `FakeActuator`). It has the same three-part surface as the fake — callable `(verb, cam) -> bool`, `pump()
# -> (dead, posted)`, `stop_all()` — so the worker does not know which it holds. It builds one
# `Gst.Pipeline` per camera from a launch string, keeps them in a dict, and turns bus messages into two
# lists the worker drains on every pass: cameras whose pipeline errored (`dead`) and element messages that
# are observations (`posted`). "The element never knows about buckets or epochs: it posts what it saw; the
# worker, which holds the epoch, turns it into a line." Importing `archivesink` and `driverpacksrc` here
# registers both elements.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `log` — logger `gstvms`.
# - `DESC` — the worker's launch template: `driverpacksrc name=src ! h264parse ! watchdog
#   timeout={watchdog} ! tee name=t`, then two leaky branches: `rtph264pay ! udpsink 127.0.0.1:{port}` (the
#   loopback RTP the RTSP fan-out re-serves as rtsp://<server>:8554/<cam> — subscribers on any server) and
#   `shmsink socket-path=<SHM_DIR>/<cam>.shm` (the same bytes in shared memory — subscribers on THIS server,
#   the recorder first, read it with `shmsrc`: no RTSP hop, no fan-out process on the recording path). No
#   `archivesink`: the worker records nothing. `watchdog` posts an error if no buffer passes for `timeout`
#   ms, which is how a stalled source becomes a dead camera.
# - `REC_DESC` / `REC_SHM_DESC` — the recorder's: `rtspsrc location=<live_url> ! rtph264depay` or
#   `shmsrc socket-path=<…>.shm` (the source the recorder chose by where the worker is), then `h264parse !
#   watchdog ! archivesink camera={cam} epoch={epoch} …` under the RECORDER's epoch.
#
# ## Notes
# - Verified where: the README says `gstvms/` is written to GStreamer's Python binding and not exercised in
#   the test run; the logic it calls (`promote`, `resolve`) is. The zombie with two real worker processes
#   and `kill -9` mid-segment on real files are the box's exercises.
# - Bus callbacks run on the GLib main context; since the worker runs no GLib main loop, `add_signal_watch`
#   delivery depends on the default main context being iterated — the code as written relies on it, and the
#   worker's loop only reads the lists `pump` hands back.
