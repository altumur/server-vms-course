"""driverpack://file/<name> -> a path under MEDIA_DIR. Pure: no GStreamer,

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # uri.py — `driverpack://file/<name>` resolved to a path under `MEDIA_DIR`, and every other URI refused —
# pure, no GStreamer
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 2's one testable piece without a media stack. A camera's `source` field is
# a `driverpack://` URI: the real DriverPack opens vendor streams behind it
# (`driverpack://<vendor>/<host>`); this course ships only `driverpack://file/<name>`, a media file played
# in a loop. This module decides which is which and where the file is, and it deliberately imports nothing
# from GStreamer so the worker and the tests can resolve and refuse without one. Called by
# `driverpacksrc.DriverPackSrc.do_set_property` when the `uri` property is set. Tested by
# `test_lesson2_driverpacksrc.py::test_uri_resolution_and_the_refusal`.
#
# ## Notes
# - The refusal is the whole point of the URI scheme: a camera row can carry a vendor URI today and be
#   placed, edited and shown by the controller and console — none of which look at `source` — and only the
#   worker's element says it cannot open it.

# `media_dir` defaults to `$MEDIA_DIR` (`/data/media`; `deploy/vms.env.example` sets it, and
# `vmsworker@.container` mounts it read-only). `urlsplit(uri)` and then three refusals, each a `ValueError`:
# - scheme is not `driverpack` — "not a driverpack URI" (`rtsp://…` is refused: the VMS never opens a stream
#   itself);
# - netloc is not `file` — "driverpack://<vendor>/… names a vendor driver; this course ships only
#   driverpack://file/<name>" (`driverpack://hikvision/10.0.0.7`; the test checks the words "vendor driver"
#   in the message);
# - the path, with its leading `/` stripped, is empty, contains `/`, or contains `..` — "bad media name"
#   (`driverpack://file/../etc/passwd`, `driverpack://file/`).
#
# Returns `<media_dir>/<name>`. The name is exactly one path segment, so the element can only ever open a
# file directly inside `MEDIA_DIR`.
