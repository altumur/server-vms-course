"""Two jobs in one loop, and what it costs to report them as one.

The controller's pass does two different things: it PLACES units, and it
PUBLISHES a copy of where they went for the layer above. They fail
independently and mean different things to whoever is woken up — and until
now they shared one `try` and one sentence in the log.

The sentence was "placement pass failed", and `publish_snapshot()` is the last
call in the block, so the message named the one thing that had *not* failed.
The other direction was worse: a placement that threw skipped the publish, the
layer above quietly went stale, and the word "snapshot" appeared nowhere.
