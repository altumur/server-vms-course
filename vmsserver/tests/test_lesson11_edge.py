"""Lessons 15 and 16 — the archive we did not write, and backfill from the edge.

A camera can have a card of its own, and behind one DriverPack connection
there can be an NVR with thirty-two channels. The holder holds the DEVICE,
not the channel: one session, N cameras, two kinds of output — the stream now
(`live_url`) and the footage the device already has (`playback_url` +
`coverage`). Reading that footage is not a subsystem: it wants exactly the
reachability the holder already has, and a subsystem is earned by a DIFFERENT
placement axis, not by different work.

What IS the recorder's is copying it: the card exists because the camera kept
recording while we could not, so replication is the difference between two
coverages — Lesson 2's loop over time. What it fetches becomes ours: our
manifest, our epoch, our retention, marked `source: edge`."""
