"""Lesson 6 — the recorder: the fourth subsystem, and the only one placed on
top of the archive. A recording is a unit named by its camera; the recorder
subscribes to the fan-out of whichever worker holds the camera — from the
heartbeat, never a second connection — takes its own epoch, and writes
footage into rec/<cam>/e<epoch>/ on ITS server's archive. The worker that
holds the camera may be anywhere; the recorder must be where the disks are.
Two trees, two writers, one camera."""
