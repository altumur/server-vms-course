"""Lesson 10 — events, and the tree that is their index. An event is an
observation, written by the worker holding a unit's epoch into that unit's
bucket on the resource (Lesson 3); the resource PROCESS reads its own tree
where it lies and serves it; the console holds nothing and asks. Three
subsystems' events land on one camera's timeline, fenced by their own
epochs; a fresh index over the same tree gives the same answer; retention on
the resource takes the events with the file."""
