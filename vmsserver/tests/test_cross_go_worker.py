"""The one test that holds the two halves together.

Everything else in this package proves Python self-consistent, and `../vmsserver-go`'s 89 tests prove Go
self-consistent. Neither says a word about whether the two AGREE — and they meet nowhere but in the
store, so a disagreement would be silent: a renamed heartbeat field, a slot row written with a different
spelling, a manifest line with a float where the other side expects an int. Nothing would fail to
compile, no suite would go red, and the first sign of it would be a camera that is placed and never
recorded.

So this runs the real Go binary against the real Python controller over one directory, and asserts what
each half can only learn from the other:

  1. the Python controller places a camera on a worker it has never spoken to and can only SEE — the Go
     worker's heartbeat is the entire basis for the decision;
  2. the Go worker reads that placement out of its assignment row, takes the epoch, and says so in a
     heartbeat Python parses back into the console's read model;
  3. a planned stop (SIGTERM) releases the slot ON PURPOSE, which is a different row from a lapse — the
     thing М10A Lesson 22's rolling upgrade depends on.

The Go half lives in the PRODUCT now, not in the course: `../vmsserver-go/` is kept as the product's
port and is no longer written alongside these lessons. This test therefore runs only when it is asked
for — `VMS_GO_PARITY=1`, with a Go toolchain present — and skips otherwise. That is the honest shape for
a check that spans a boundary the course does not own: it stays here, buildable and true, and it does
not colour the course's suite red because something on the other side of the boundary moved.
