"""An archive that stops answering — the network volume behind a recording, gone for a minute or an hour.

The recorder already has the right buffer: the pipeline writes into a LOCAL spool and never touches the
network, and every pass `promote_closed` moves what has closed into the archive. So an outage should cost
nothing but a queue: keep recording into the spool, and move the backlog across when the link returns.

These tests pin that, starting with the part that was not true: that the recorder keeps LIVING while its
archive is unreachable. A recorder that stops renewing its leases loses its epochs, and one that stops
heartbeating is reassigned by its controller — either way the recording ends, and it ends because of the
one component that was supposed to be optional for a while.
