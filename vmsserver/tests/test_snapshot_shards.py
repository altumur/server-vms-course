"""The snapshot's SHAPE: one object per worker, not one object per cluster.

Every other object the platform publishes is already sharded by its writer — a
heartbeat per worker, a resource heartbeat per server — and each one stays the
size of what that writer knows. The snapshot was the exception: one object
holding every unit in the cluster, published into a store with a ceiling. Nomad
Variables, where М11's objects lived then, cap an object at 64 KiB, and the
cluster's own design maximum is 600 cameras (12 workers x capacity 50, from the
worker jobspec). The single object broke at about a third of that.

М11's objects are files on every server now (`cluster://`), with no ceiling.
The shape stays: a store may still declare one (`limits.py`), and a shard is
what keeps the snapshot inside whatever it declares.

Sharded by the worker that holds the unit, it grows the way the cluster grows:
more units means more workers means more objects, each the size of one worker's
assignment. The arithmetic is measured below rather than asserted.
