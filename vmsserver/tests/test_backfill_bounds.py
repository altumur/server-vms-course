"""Lesson 16, from the product — the three bounds backfill was missing.

Written after the course's recorder ran on a real box (ОБРАТНАЯ-СВЯЗЬ-ИЗ-ПРОДУКТА.md, points P, Q and S):

    P  what a clean fetch found nowhere is remembered, per source, and not planned again — a summary
       cannot say where a card's holes are, and without this the same empty range is fetched every pass
    Q  the upper bound is the end of what we can SEE — a reader sees closed blocks only — not a guess called
       `settle` that held only while `settle` was longer than the lag, an inequality written nowhere
    S  planned backfill fills holes INSIDE what a recording recorded — before its first second it was not
       recording by design, and filling that turns a recording on events into a recording always
