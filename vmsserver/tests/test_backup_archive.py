"""Lesson 26 — a backup archive of our own.

Lesson 16 closed a recording's gaps from the DEVICE's archive — whatever a camera keeps on its card, read
through the holder's playback door. The product found that door closed (its DriverPack binding has no
playback calls yet) and a better one open: our own archives. A critical camera is recorded twice — its
primary recording, and a BACKUP recording on a volume of kind `backup`: a second server's disk, or the
card of a camera that runs this platform. The primary closes any hole from the backup — a link that
dropped, the seconds its own recorder took to move — by COPYING the backup's footage, cut to the hole, with
the times it was recorded at. The mechanism is Lesson 16's, over a second kind of source.
