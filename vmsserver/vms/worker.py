"""vmsworker — DriverPack as the worker: the process that HOLDS a camera.

One process, N pipelines, its own loop. It reads its assignment
(vms/workers/<me>) and the camera rows it names, runs М9's reconcile loop
over them with the actuator that builds `driverpacksrc ! tee` and serves the
tee as an RTSP fan-out (`rtsp://<server>:8554/<cam>`, in the heartbeat as
`live_url`) — one connection to the camera, N subscribers: the recorder
(the fourth subsystem, on a server with an archive), live gateways,
detectors, on any server. It takes an epoch per camera by CAS when it
starts one, holds a lease per camera, writes what it observes into the
camera's bucket on ITS server's resource, and publishes a heartbeat
carrying its status. It records nothing: recording is the recorder's
(`recorder.py`), a subscriber like any other. It never writes
configuration. Nomad (or systemd, on one box) supervises the process; the
process supervises its pipelines; nothing supervises the loop, because the
loop is the process.

What the environment hands a process, on a box or in an allocation:

    WORKER_NAME / SLOT_INDEX     -> the slot to claim: w-<index>. The index is the preference;
                                    the claim (CAS on vms/slots/w-N) is the proof
    SERVER_NAME (or the hostname) -> `server` in the heartbeat: whose resource its events go to, and the host in `live_url`
    LABELS                        -> `labels` in the heartbeat: what this server can reach; the controller places by them
    INSTANCE_ID                   -> the instance; CAPACITY -> the worker's own number, from М9 Lesson 7's probe

Not one of those names an orchestrator, and that is deliberate: a Quadlet, a
Nomad jobspec and a Kubernetes manifest each map their own names into these
five (`w2cplatform/runtime.py`), and the loop never learns which did.

# ================================================================================================
# # worker.py — vmsworker: DriverPack as the worker — N pipelines against an assignment, an epoch per
# camera,
# a lease, a heartbeat with server, labels and capacity
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 4. One process, N pipelines, its own loop. `VmsWorker` extends
# `w2cplatform.contract.Worker` (see `contract.py` for `claim_slot`, `renew_slot`, `release_slot`,
# `take_epoch`, `renew_leases`, `heartbeat`) and is the thing that knows what a camera is. It reads its
# assignment `vms/workers/<me>` and the camera rows it names, runs М9's `Reconciler` over them
# (`reconciler.py`) with an actuator that builds `driverpacksrc ! tee ! archivesink` (`gstvms/actuator.py`;
# `FakeActuator` here without GStreamer), takes an epoch per camera by CAS when it starts one, holds a lease
# per camera, writes events into the camera's bucket on this server's resource, and publishes a heartbeat
# carrying its status. It never writes configuration: its token is `vms/epoch/*`, `vms/slots/*` and
# `vms/devices/*` — the last one what it found a device to be, a discovery and not a decision. Nomad or
# systemd supervises the process; the process supervises its pipelines; nothing supervises the loop, because
# the loop is the process. The docstring names what the environment hands a process: `WORKER_NAME` /
# `NOMAD_ALLOC_INDEX` (the slot preference; the CAS claim on `vms/slots/w-N` is the proof),
# `NOMAD_NODE_NAME` or the hostname (`server`: which resource it records into), `NOMAD_META_labels`
# (`labels`: what this server can reach; the controller places by them), `NOMAD_ALLOC_ID` (the instance),
# `CAPACITY` (the worker's own number, from М9 Lesson 7's probe). Run by `__main__.worker`; tested in
# `tests/test_lesson4_worker.py` and used across Lesson 6's tests.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `log` — logger `vmsworker`.
# - `VMS` — `Subsystem("vms")`, the key layout.
#
# ### `__init__(self, name, vars_, objects, actuator=None, lease_ttl=30.0, lease_margin=5.0,
# clock=time.monotonic, wall=time.time, server=None, capacity=None, instance=None, slot_ttl=45.0,
# archive_root=None, bucket_seconds=600, env=None)` `env` defaults to `os.environ` (tests pass a dict).
# `instance` defaults to `NOMAD_ALLOC_ID`, else the base class's `hostname:pid:6hex`. Calls
# `Worker.__init__` with `name=None` and then `claim_slot(prefer=name or slot_from_environment(env))` — so
# construction *is* the claim, and `self.name` is set afterwards. Then: `archive_root` from the argument or
# `$ARCHIVE` (`/data/archive`); `capacity` from the argument or `$CAPACITY` (50) — "М9 Lesson 7's B + n·I,
# measured on ITS server"; the actuator (`FakeActuator()` if none); an empty `rows`; the `Reconciler(self,
# self._actuate)`; `recording_allowed = True`; `server` from the argument, `NOMAD_NODE_NAME`,
# `NOMAD_NODE_ID`, else the hostname; `labels`, `alloc`; the two start clocks. Finally it reads the previous
# heartbeat object of this slot name: if one exists and was written by a different instance, `previous_hb`
# is its `ts` and `previous_instance` its instance — the controller's `failover_seconds` computes `started −
# previous_hb` from these, measured from what the workers wrote.
# `test_a_replacement_without_a_name_inherits_the_lapsed_slot`: two nameless workers get `w-1`, `w-2`; after
# `w-1` lapses (46 s of wall clock) a third nameless worker gets `w-1` back and starts its two cameras with
# epoch 2.
#
# ## Notes
# - Ordering: the slot is claimed in the constructor, before any assignment is read (the name is the row
#   key); an epoch is taken in `_actuate` before the pipeline starts; `lease_pass` checks the slot before
#   the leases.
# - Recovery needs no controller: `test_restart_with_the_controller_stopped` deletes the controller, starts
#   a fresh `w-1` with an empty `actual`, and it starts all three cameras from its assignment with epoch 2
#   each — the old instance is fenced by construction.
# - Three exits from a lost lease, all in `lease_pass`: reassignment (stop that one, continue), zombie
#   (fence everything), and slot taken (fence everything, first). A lease that merely expired because the
#   loop stalled shows up as `may_write` false in `_actuate` and a fresh epoch on the next start.
# - `observe` returns the bucket path, which the tests read back with `read_bucket`; the worker keeps
#   `observed` only for tests and diagnostics.
