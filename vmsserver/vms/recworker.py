"""recworker — the fourth subsystem's worker: the only one placed on top of the archive.

A recorder is a worker in the platform's sense (a slot claimed by CAS —
`r-1` — an assignment read from the store, an epoch per unit, a heartbeat
with capacity and headroom) whose unit is ONE RECORDING of a camera,
`rec/recordings/<name>` — a camera written to two archives has two of them,
and the row's `cam` field says whose footage this one holds. It does not
hold the camera: it subscribes to the fan-out of whichever VMS worker does
(`live_url` in the VMS heartbeat, found the way a gateway finds it — never
by calling a worker, never a second connection to the camera) and writes
footage into `rec/<name>/e<epoch>/` on the archive it is homed to, with the
manifest beside it. The worker that holds
the camera may be anywhere, `servers: shared`; the recorder must be where
the disks are — `requires: resource`, `servers: distinct` by default — and
when its server dies the controller moves its recordings to a server whose
resource answers (Lesson 4's two silences). Footage from before the move
stays where it was written, under the old epoch; the console's timeline
merges the two.

    RECORDER_NAME / SLOT_INDEX     -> the slot to claim: r-<index>
    SERVER_NAME (or the hostname)  -> `server` in the heartbeat: whose archive it writes into
    SPOOL, ARCHIVE                     -> the archive resource's two roots on this server
    CAPACITY                           -> recordings this server's disks and NIC can take — its own number

Same class as the worker (`VmsWorker` over the `rec` rows): the same
reconciler, the same gate (an epoch per unit, a lease, the fence at the
slot), the same heartbeat. What differs is what the pipeline needs — a
source, not a camera — and that closed segments are promoted from the
spool into the archive on every pass.

# An archive that fails is either AWAY or WRONG, and the two are answered differently: an archive that is
# away is kept and buffered into, one that is wrong is handed back so its recordings can go somewhere that
# works. The errno says which.

# WRONG is only what nothing but a person will change: no permission (a key revoked, a policy changed), a
# path component that is a file, a read-only filesystem. Everything else is AWAY — a timeout, a refused or
# reset connection, a network that is down, an I/O error on a mount that went quiet — and so is whatever
# nobody listed, because the cost of guessing wrong is lopsided: an away archive handed back reshuffles
# recordings for a link that is back in a minute, while a wrong one kept is a spool that queues, visibly.
#
# Two that look wrong and are not. "No space" is an archive its OWN watermark empties (Lesson 18), and that
# pass is run by the recorder holding it: hand it back and the one process that could free it stops

    # -- a primary in ANOTHER cluster (М12 Lesson 13) --------------------------------------------------------
    # The rule above looks for the primary in this cluster's rows and this cluster's heartbeats. A camera
    # that is a cluster of its own, recorded by a server room, has neither: its primary is a row of the
    # room's cluster, written by the room's recorder. Looking only here, the backup on its card found no
    # primary and never covered — not when the room was down either, which is the one moment it exists for.
    #
    # So the domain, which reads both clusters, writes a BOOK OF PRIMARIES for the camera's cluster, and the
    # camera's agent carries it home like the grants: per camera, by the domain's name for it (`ref`), who
    # records it, whether it SHOULD be written, whether it IS, and whether it is still STARTING (no recorder
    # of that cluster has named it yet — the only case that gets the grace). No timestamps in it, on purpose: a book that
    # changed on every pass of the domain would be rewritten on the camera's flash every few seconds. How
    # current the book is comes separately — the time the agent last reached the domain, an object in the
    # cluster's object store (RAM on a camera). A book the agent has not refreshed for `lost_after` is a book

    # only once it is closed, a range just copied is invisible for minutes, and was being remembered as "not on
    # the card either" and never planned again. Delivered is what came back: landed, or dropped because live
