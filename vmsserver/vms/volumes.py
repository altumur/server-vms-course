"""The archives a recording may be written into: `rec/volumes/<name>`, the
administrator's list, and the claim that makes one of them served."""
# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # volumes.py — a volume is a PLACE, declared by the operator and served by whoever takes it
#
# **Role in the module.** Until now the archives a box could write into were deployment: a directory per
# disk, an `ARCHIVE` in the unit file, an instance per volume. That works while a volume is a disk somebody
# screwed into a rack. It stops working the day a volume is a bucket: the operator creates it in the
# console, and nobody is going to edit a systemd unit for it.
#
# So a volume becomes a row — `rec/volumes/<name>`, the `tables:` grant of `rec.subsystem.yaml` — and a
# **place** in the sense placement already means (`place_by: volume`). The row is a DECLARATION: it says
# this archive should be written into. It does not say by whom, and it cannot: the row is written on a
# console, and which process serves it is a fact about the cluster at this second.
#
# That fact is a `hold` (`w2cplatform.contract`): `rec/holds/<volume>`, the same row and the same
# CAS-with-a-lease rule as a worker's slot. A recorder with no `VOLUME` pinned takes a free volume it may
# serve and becomes that volume's recorder; it renews while it runs; it lets go on an orderly stop; and if
# it dies the hold lapses and the next free recorder picks the volume up. Nobody assigns, nobody starts a
# process: the controller places recordings on the places that exist, and a place exists because somebody
# is holding it.
#
# **Who may serve what.** A local volume is a disk: only a recorder ON ITS SERVER can write to it. A
# network volume is an address: any box can, and exactly one does, because `servers: distinct` over
# `place_by: volume` means one recorder per place. That asymmetry is the whole reason `server` is a field
# here and empty for the network kind — and it is why one spare per box absorbs one NETWORK volume per
# box, not one per cluster: the spare that takes it may be anywhere.
#
# **Why `quota_bytes` and not free space.** It is the SIZE of the volume: the engine formats it as a ring of
# that many bytes, and the ring gives up its oldest minutes when it is full. `statvfs` on a bucket answers
# about the machine, not the bucket, so the number has to be given; and on a disk it is what lets one
# partition hold two volumes.
#
# **What is NOT here.** No mounting, no credentials handling beyond the `*_secret` suffix (the row names
# the key; `secrets.py` keeps it out of every reply), and no uploading: what turns a path into a bucket
# belongs to the archive, not to the list of archives.
#
# ## Public API
# - `Volume` — one row, as a frozen dataclass; `key(name)`, `refuse(fields)`, `write(vars_, fields)`,
#   `delete(vars_, name)`.
# - `declared(vars_)` — every volume row, enabled and not.
# - `servable(vols, server)` — the names a recorder on `server` may take, best first: its own disks, then
#   the network archives anybody may serve.
# - `holders(vars_, sub)` — `{volume: Slot}`: who is serving what, for the console.
# - `served(vars_, sub, now, lost_after)` — the console's view: every declared volume, its holder or None.
