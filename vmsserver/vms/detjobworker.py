"""The scan worker — the fifth subsystem's worker, and the first whose work ENDS.

A unit is a job: one model over one interval of one recording. The worker does
not subscribe to anything. It plans the interval out of the recording's manifest
(`vms/scan.py`), decodes each stretch in turn, writes what the model saw into the
job's own bucket on the resource, and appends a line to the job's manifest for
every stretch it finishes:

    detjob/jobs/<job>          the job: cam, rec, kind, from, to, state — written by the console
    detjob/workers/<j>         the assignment, written by the detjob controller
    detjob/<j>/heartbeat       capacity, headroom, labels; per-job status: phase, done_through, events
    <archive>/detjob/<job>/e<epoch>/…events.jsonl   what the model saw
    <archive>/detjob/<job>/manifest.jsonl           how far it got — durable, so a restart resumes

Three things separate it from `DetWorker`, and all three come from the work
having both ends. It runs a BUDGET of stretches per pass rather than a frame:
a job is hours of video and a pass that finished it would starve the heartbeat.
Its events are stamped with MEDIA time, not the clock. And it is the only worker
that can say `done` — which nothing in the placement vocabulary reads yet, so the
row stays placed until the console's reaper moves its state (Lesson 21).

The MODEL is the same object as the live detector's, and that is the point: it
takes a timestamp and answers what it saw. Nothing in it knows whether the frame
behind that timestamp came off a fan-out or off a disk.
