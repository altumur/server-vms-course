# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # console.py — the one-box console: the platform's SpecConsole over the VMS spec, plus the two media
# routes
# only a VMS has
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 6. Everything an operator's console needs to list, create, edit and delete
# cameras, show where they run, export metrics and take marks is `w2cplatform.console.SpecConsole` reading
# `vms.subsystem.yaml` (see `w2cplatform/console.py`); nothing in this file knows what a camera's fields
# are. What the VMS adds is the bytes: `GET /timeline/<id>?from&to` (segments and event buckets from this
# box's archive manifest, fenced ones marked) and `GET /segment/<path>` (one promoted segment, `Range`
# honoured, for the page's `<video>`). They are *registered* as the console's `extra` route function, not
# subclassed. The console is its own process (`python3 -m vms console`, `deploy/console.container`) with
# its own token — `vms/cameras/*`, `vms/next_id`, `vms/retention/*`, `vms/idem/*` — and never placement.
# Depends on `archive.py` (`ArchiveResource`, `Manifest`) and `controller.py`.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `PAGE`, `send_file` — re-exported from `w2cplatform.console` (`noqa: F401`) for М11, which serves the
#   same page and the same ranged file replies from a Nomad job.
#
# ## Notes
# - `test_the_console_over_http` walks the whole surface through this `serve`: an idempotent POST is one
#   camera; the console's `VmsController` cannot `place` (its token); `PUT {"worker": "w-9"}` is 400;
#   `/cameras` shows `phase running`, `server srv-1`; `/where/1` agrees with the assignments; `/spec` says
#   `rows cameras, media true`; `/metrics` has `vms_cameras_running 1`; a mark lands in
#   `console/<unit>/e1/…` and `subsystems_under(archive)` shows only `console` — never `vms/1/`, whose
#   bucket has one writer; the page never says "camera" outside its HTML comment; then `/timeline/1`, a
#   ranged `/segment/`, a 404, a PUT that bumps `revision` to 2, and a DELETE whose placement waits for
#   `unplace_deleted`.
# - The archive mount in `console.container` is what lets `/segment/` serve bytes; `/data/spool` is
#   mounted read-only there because the console reads and never records.

# is `None` (a console without a resource on its server — the second console in
# `test_a_retry_that_lands_on_another_console_is_one_camera` is built that way). Otherwise:
#
# - `GET /segment/<rel>` — `rel` is joined under `archive.root`. If it contains `..` or is not a regular
#   file the reply is `404 {detail, error: "no such segment"}`. Otherwise `send_file(handler, path,
#   "video/mp4")` writes the reply itself (whole, or `206` with `Content-Range` when the request carried
#   `Range`) and `extra` returns `()` — the console's signal that the reply was already served. The test
#   asks `bytes=10-19` of a 256-byte segment and gets exactly those bytes with `Content-Range: bytes
#   10-19/256`; a path that does not exist is 404.
# - `GET /timeline/<id>?from&to` — `int` of the last path segment; `200` with `Manifest(archive.root,
#   cid).timeline(from, to)` — `from` defaults to 0, `to` to `1e12`. Note `current_epoch` is not passed
#   here, so on one box no span is marked `fenced` by this route; the `Manifest.timeline` fencing is
#   exercised directly in `test_lesson3_archive.py`.

# `spare: 0` with `serving < wanted` is the one state that needs a person: an archive was declared and
# there is no process free to serve it. The console says so; it does not start one. Starting processes is
# the scheduler's, here as everywhere — what the platform owes is the number, not the action.
# How many recorder processes are missing, and THE COMMAND that starts them — written out, for the
# operator to run. Not a button: a console with a token to its orchestrator would be a console that can
# start processes, which is the one thing this whole design keeps out of the platform (М10A, lesson 7).
# What it can do is stop making the operator translate. It knows how many are missing (an archive is
# declared and nobody, spare included, can take it), and it knows which orchestrator started IT —
# `NOMAD_ALLOC_ID` in its own environment — so it can write the line out in that orchestrator's words.
#
# The slot name for a box is the next free number: instances are named by the slot they claim
# (`recworker@r-3` claims `r-3`), so the command has to name one nobody holds.

# Why here and not in the platform's `metrics_text`: it counts VOLUMES, and the platform has never heard

# Running, and holding no archive. Two sources and not one, because the obvious single source is wrong
# in a window that lasts: a recorder names its volume in the heartbeat once it has TAKEN it, and taking
# is not opening — a bucket whose previous writer is still letting go can take the better part of a
# minute. A process counted spare in that window is a spare the operator is promised and the scaling
# policy will not ask to replace, and both numbers heal themselves, which is exactly when nobody notices.
