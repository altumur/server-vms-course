                                                   (w2cplatform.events), written by the WORKER holding the
                                                   camera, whether or not anything records it; on the
                                                   worker's server, which need not be the recorder's

Two subsystems, two trees, one camera. The worker (`vms`) holds the camera —
one connection, one epoch, the fan-out — and writes what it observes into
`vms/<cam>/`. The recorder (`rec`) is placed on a server with an archive,
subscribes to the worker's fan-out, and writes footage under its own epoch
into `rec/<unit>/` — the recording's own directory, named by the operator
(`7`, `7-cloud`) and not by the camera. A camera that is watched and never recorded has buckets
and no `rec/` tree; a camera whose recorder moved has footage under two
servers' `rec/` trees, merged by the console. The manifest indexes media
only; events are answered by the resource's event index, over their own buckets.

The acknowledgement order is М9 Lesson 4's: a closed segment is PROMOTED
(renamed into the archive, then a manifest line appended), and the spool
copy is gone only after that. The manifest is append-only and rebuildable
from the files.

Retention is a policy, per kind. Media is the recorder's: `retain()` after
the recording row's `retention_days`, files first then lines. Buckets are
the PLATFORM's (w2cplatform.resource): the VMS controller writes
`vms/retention/<cam> {days: events_retention_days}` and the resource job
deletes the files — events are small and often kept a year where footage
is kept a month.

The layout is `<subsystem>/<unit>/...` — the platform resource's tree — so
that every subsystem's data sits on the same server under its own prefix.
`ArchivePolicy` is what the recorder registers with the platform's resource
job: its own pass over its own part of the tree.

# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # archive.py — the archive resource: promotion, the manifest, repair, media retention; the recorder's tree
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 3 (the archive as a resource) and Lesson 6 (the recorder). Media lives under
# `rec/<unit>/e<epoch>/` on the recorder's server; the camera's event buckets live under `vms/<cam>/e<epoch>/`
# on the worker's server (`event_log`, the platform's `EventLog`). `segment_path`/`parse` name and read the
# media paths; `Manifest` is the per-camera index beside the footage — media lines only, since the events
# are answered by the resource's event index; `ArchiveResource` promotes closed segments from the spool,
# repairs manifests from the files, retains media by days; `ArchivePolicy` is the hook the recorder
# registers with the platform's resource job (`vms/resource.py`).
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `SUB = "rec"` — the recorder's tree; `EVENTS_SUB = "vms"` — the worker's, for `event_log`.
# - `SEGMENT`, `EPOCH_DIR` — the path grammar: `<sub>/<unit>/e<epoch>/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>.mp4`.
#
# ## Notes
# - `test_promote_then_line_then_spool_copy_gone`, `test_manifest_rebuilt_from_the_files_alone`,
#   `test_retention_file_first_then_line`, `test_timeline_marks_a_fenced_epoch_and_spans_two_resources` walk
#   these; `test_events_are_buckets_on_the_resource_recording_or_not` shows the two trees side by side.
# - `_move` renames within a filesystem and copies-then-replaces across one: a segment appears in the archive
#   whole or not at all, and the spool copy goes last.
