"""The resource process — the platform's resource job (w2cplatform.resource)
with the VMS registered on it. One per server, pinned there for as long as
the server exists; on a box it is `python3 -m vms resource`
(`deploy/resource.container`), in М11 the `resource` system job. It has
no controller: it has a policy pass on a timer, a heartbeat, its HTTP, and
the event index over its own tree. What the VMS adds is its part:

    ArchivePolicy   registered as the "rec" hook: the recorder's — repair the manifests, retain media by rec/recordings/<unit>,
                    and free bytes when the disk is over its watermark (vms/space.py)
    vms_routes      GET /manifest/<unit>  the manifest's lines;  GET /segment/<path>  the bytes, Range honoured;
                    GET /space  what is here, how deep it goes, and what of it another server writes now
    vms_writes      PUT /segment/<path>   a segment arriving from the resource that is giving it up

    platform/resources/<server>/heartbeat   {server, ts, url, usage, units, mirrors} — how the console finds it
    GET <url>/events?from&to&cam&kind&subsystem&unit   the platform's: this resource's EventIndex
    GET <url>/buckets/<sub>/<unit>, /events/<path>, /mirrored/<server>; PUT /mirror/<server>/<path>

Nothing about heartbeats, buckets, mirrors or the event index is the VMS's, and
the names say so: platform/resources/<server>/heartbeat, platform/mirror.

# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # resource.py — the resource process: the platform's Resource with the VMS's policy, routes and the event
# index
#
# **Role in the module.** Lesson 10 (events) and Lesson 11 (the box). The archive was a resource from Lesson
# 3 — pinned, registered on, never placed — and this is the process that stands for it: the platform's
# `Resource` over `/data/archive` with `ArchivePolicy` registered as the `rec` hook (the recorder's: manifest
# repair, media retention by the recording row), a heartbeat under `platform/resources/<server>`, the platform's HTTP (`w2cplatform.resource.
# serve`) with the VMS's two reads added, and an `EventIndex` over the tree — nothing to rebuild, nothing to
# tail — served as `GET /events`. The console holds no index: it asks this process (`MergedIndex`). М11 runs the
# same function as the `resource` job on every server (`cluster/resource.py` re-exports it), which is the
# point: the box and the cluster have one architecture.
#
# ## Module-level names
# None.
#
# ### `vms_routes(archive) -> extra(path, headers)`
# The VMS's reads on the resource, plugged into the platform's server: `GET /manifest/<unit>` returns the
# manifest's raw lines; `GET /segment/<path>` the bytes of one promoted segment with `Range` honoured (206 +
# `Content-Range`), 404 for `..` or a missing file. М11's console proxies `/segment` to this.
#
# ### `vms_resource(archive, server, url, vars_, objects, wall=None, peers=None) -> Resource`
# Builds the platform's `Resource` on the archive's root with the archive's `bucket_seconds` and clock,
# registers `ArchivePolicy(archive, vars_)` as the `rec` hook (footage is the recorder's subsystem; the
# worker's tree under `vms/` holds events only, retained by the platform's bucket policy), and attaches `resource.index =
# EventIndex(root, server, wall, bucket_seconds)` — ready as it is made: it reads the tree where it lies, at
# the moment of each query. `retain()` tells it what it removed; `serve()` answers `/events` from it.
#
# ## Notes
# - The old `vms-archive-retain.timer` ran the same policy as a oneshot every ten minutes; the process runs
#   it every 600 s from its loop and adds what a oneshot could not hold: a heartbeat, a port, an index's cache.
