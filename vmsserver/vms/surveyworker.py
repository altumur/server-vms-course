"""The survey worker — the sixth subsystem's worker, and the only one whose input
is an archive we do not own.

It watches a camera's DEVICE archive — the card, the NVR — forever, and copies
nothing. The video stays where it is; what comes out is events:

    survey/watches/<name>        the unit: cam, kind, params — written by the console
    survey/workers/<s>           the assignment, written by the survey controller
    survey/<s>/heartbeat         capacity, headroom, labels; per-unit status: phase, lag, events
    <archive>/survey/<name>/e<epoch>/…events.jsonl   what the model saw
    <archive>/survey/<name>/frontier.json            how far it has watched

Three things shape it, and all three come from the archive being somebody else's.

The INDEX says where to look. A device recording on motion has mostly nothing
between its first and last minute, and walking that as if it were continuous
would spend the whole budget on silence.

The DOOR is the limit, not the GPU. A device allows two playback sessions and
they are shared with the operator watching and the recorder saving; when they
are gone this worker waits and says so, rather than retrying into a wall.

And the frontier MOVES ON. It is not a plan to finish but an edge to keep up
with — so what matters is not "did we cover everything" but how far behind the
device's newest minute we are, which is what `lag` in the heartbeat says.
