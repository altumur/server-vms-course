"""Reading an INTERVAL of the archive, and remembering how far you got.

    <archive>/rec/<unit>/manifest.jsonl        what the recorder wrote: the media index
    <archive>/detjob/<job>/manifest.jsonl      what a scan has processed: one line per stretch

The live detector never needed this file. It reads a fan-out with no beginning
and no end, and "where am I" is "now". A scan over recorded footage has both
ends, so it needs the two things the live path never asked for: which segments
cover `[from, to)`, and which of them are already behind it.

Both answers come out of the manifest and nothing else — no Variables, no
heartbeat, no call to another server. That matters for footage from last March:
who currently holds the recording says nothing about who won the race for those
minutes, and the archive may be read on a box where no recorder runs at all.

The progress file is the recorder's manifest again, in shape and for the same
reasons (М10B Lesson 3): append-only, rebuildable from what it describes, and a
crash between the work and the line costs a re-scan of one stretch rather than
a wrong answer.
