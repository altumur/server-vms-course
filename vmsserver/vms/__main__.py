# ================================================================================================
# NOTES — what every part of this file does and why (kept beside the code, not in a separate document)
# ================================================================================================
# # __main__.py — `python3 -m vms worker | controller | console | resource | …`: the box's processes
#
# **Role in the module.** The entrypoint every deploy unit runs (`deploy/*.container` all say `Exec=python3
# -m vms <verb>`; the Containerfile's default `CMD` is `worker`). It reads the environment, opens the two
# file-backed stores under `$PLATFORM_DIR` with the *right token for the verb*, builds the process's object
# from `worker.py` / `controller.py` / `console.py` / `resource.py` / …, and runs it until SIGTERM/SIGINT. It is
# glue and nothing else: no logic of its own beyond wiring, and each verb's token is deliberately narrower
# than the whole `vms/*` prefix. `tests/test_deploy_units.py` imports this module (without running it) and
# checks that the verbs in the dispatch table are exactly the ones the units invoke.
#
# Environment (from the docstring and the code):
# - `PLATFORM_DIR` (default `/data/platform`) — the platform's stores: `<dir>/config` is `FileVariables`,
#   `<dir>/objects` is `FsObjectStore`.
# - `SPOOL` (`/data/spool`), `ARCHIVE` (`/data/archive`) — the archive resource's two roots. `MEDIA_DIR` is
#   read by `gstvms/uri.py`, not here.
# - `WORKER_NAME` — the slot to claim (systemd's `%i`); unset: `NOMAD_ALLOC_INDEX` → `w-<index>`; neither:
#   `None`, which makes `VmsWorker` claim the first free slot, a lapsed one first.
# - `CAPACITY` (default `50`) — cameras this worker can carry; exported as `headroom`. Also passed to the
#   controller and console as the *fallback* for a worker whose heartbeat says nothing.
# - `SEGMENT_SECONDS` (default `600`) — segment length handed to `GstActuator`.
# - `CONSOLE_HOST` (`127.0.0.1`), `CONSOLE_PORT` (`8080`) — where the console listens
#   (`console.container` sets `0.0.0.0`).
# - `RESOURCE_HOST` (`127.0.0.1`), `RESOURCE_PORT` (`8090`), `RESOURCE_URL` — the resource process's HTTP and the URL
#   its heartbeat advertises (the console asks `/events` there).
# - `LOG_LEVEL` (`INFO`) — `logging.basicConfig` level.
#
# ## Module-level names
# - `root` — `$PLATFORM_DIR`, read once at import.
# - `stop` — a `threading.Event` set by the SIGTERM/SIGINT handler installed at import time; every verb
#   loops on it. Because the handler is installed at import, importing the module (as the deploy test does)
#   also installs the handlers in the importing process.
#
# ### `if __name__ == "__main__"`
# Dispatch table on `sys.argv[1]`: worker, controller, console, resource, gateway, livecontroller, detworker,
# detcontroller. `test_the_units_run_the_entrypoints_the_package_has` regex-extracts the names and matches
# them against the `Exec=` lines of the Quadlet units.
#
# ## Notes
# - Three tokens, three processes: `vmsworker` (epochs, slots), `vmscontroller` (placement), `console`
#   (the operator's rows). Together they partition `vms/*`; none of them can do another's job. The mounts in
#   `deploy/` repeat the same split in bytes (`test_who_may_write_where_is_in_the_mounts_too`).
# - `CAPACITY` means two different things depending on the verb: the worker's own number (what it heartbeats
#   and places by) versus the controller's fallback for a worker that has not spoken yet
#   (`test_capacity_is_the_workers_word_not_the_controllers`).
# - `resource` runs the platform's `Resource` as a process on the box exactly as М11 runs it as a job:
#   heartbeat, HTTP, the policy pass (the VMS's hook first, then bucket retention, then the mirror — off on
#   one box), and the `EventIndex` over the tree. The old `retain` verb and its timer are gone: a pass
#   every 600 s from the process's loop is the same pass, and a oneshot could not hold an index's cache.

# (Lesson 27), so it is the console's to collect; the controller could not delete a blob if it wanted to,

# know when nothing names it.
#
# Its own loop and its own log line. That is Lesson 28 applied before the same mistake is made twice: a
# sweep that fails inside somebody else's `try` would be reported as somebody else's failure, and the
# consequence — blobs accumulating with nothing reclaiming them — is exactly the kind that shows up as a
# disk full a year later.
